Refer to the Investors link under the Corporate section of our homepage.
Please reference slide 2 before we begin, where we offer a couple of reminders.
We undertake no obligation to update these statements beyond what is required under applicable securities laws.
I hope all of you on the call are staying healthy and safe.
Over the past year, I'm pleased to say that our team has consistently risen to the challenges that fundamentally impacted not only our businesses and markets, but the ways we work and live.
While many of those challenges continue to affect our daily lives, they are no longer unprecedented.
We've learned to be more agile to adapt and respond to changing market condition, demonstrating that strong execution and an uncompromising commitment to our people and our customers can drive exceptional performance even against this backdrop.
We certainly demonstrated this in the first quarter, delivering great operational and financial results by leveraging our market leading positions, unique product and process technologies and enterprise operating model to capitalize on strong or improving market conditions.
, before turning it over to Ken, who will provide additional details on our financial performance.
I will then come back to talk about our business outlook for the second quarter and share our perspective on key markets.
As always, I will begin my review at safety, where our collective focus remains working together to keep each other, our customers and our suppliers, healthy and safe.
During the first quarter, we maintained a very safe environment with an RIR of 0.64, which is in line with our full year 2020 performance.
More than half of our facilities across the globe have remained injury-free for more than a year.
Financially, we delivered record first quarter revenue of $1.9 billion, an increase of 20% compared with the first quarter of 2020, up 18% on a constant currency basis; and adjusted EBIT of $282 million, which is more than double what we reported for the same period last year and a record for any first quarter historically.
Our global teams continue to execute well, delivering outstanding financial results in a dynamic market environment, demonstrating the earnings power of our company.
Our performance during the quarter was driven by good volumes, broad price realization and strong manufacturing efficiencies across all our businesses, resulting in an adjusted EBIT margin for the company of 15%, with all three of our businesses posting double-digit EBIT margins for the third consecutive quarter.
During the quarter, we saw broad strength across many of our end markets.
Specifically, the US residential housing market continues to run at a robust pace, with both repair and remodeling activity and new construction growth driving strong demand for our products.
In addition, we continue to see many of our global markets as well as our commercial and industrial end markets improved throughout the quarter.
While market conditions have certainly turned more favorable, our operating priorities, investments and execution have positioned us to deliver these strong financial results.
Across the enterprise, we continue to invest in select growth and productivity initiatives to service our customers and improve our operating performance.
Within Insulation, we are investing in automation and process technologies to create a lower cost, more flexible manufacturing network in our residential insulation business as we commercially position ourselves to benefit from a strong housing market.
In addition, we continue to invest in new Insulation materials and systems in nonresidential applications to expand our global product offering.
In our Composites business, we are investing to grow in higher-value downstream applications, such as building and construction, wind energy and infrastructure.
And we remain focused on optimizing our low-cost manufacturing network to service key markets such as North America, Europe and India.
And in roofing, we continue to leverage our vertical integration model to develop innovative products and systems, while expanding our roofing components offering and strengthening our partnerships with contractors and distributors, to help grow their businesses with our products and brands.
All of this work is enabled by our enterprise operating model, which leverages our commercial strength, material science capabilities and global operating scale, to expand our growth opportunities, improve our operating efficiencies and generate strong free cash flow.
On the talent front, we recently announced the appointment of two great executives.
First, I'd like to congratulate Dr. Jose Mendez Andino on his recent promotion to Chief Research and Development Officer.
Material science research and product and process innovation are fundamental to what we do and how we deliver value as a company.
Jose will play a key role in leading our efforts to increase our innovation pipeline and ensure we are helping our customers win and grow in the market.
She joins us from Nordson Corporation where she served for 8 years, most recently as their General Counsel.
Gina brings more than two decades of experience working across multiple industries and will be a valuable partner to both me and our entire executive team.
Another highlight I would like to share is the recent publication of our 15th annual sustainability report titled, Beyond Today Shaping Tomorrow.
We began our sustainability journey nearly 2 decades ago.
And over the years, our goals have evolved and expanded well beyond environmental sustainability.
Today, they are built on three key pillars: expanding the positive impact of our products, reducing our environmental footprint and increasing our social impact.
We are proud of our progress and our accomplishments over the past decade across all of our 2020 sustainability goals, particularly our progress on climate action, where we have reduced absolute greenhouse gas emissions from our operations by 60% since our peak year despite adding several material acquisitions along the way.
In our recently published 2030 goals, we are committed to further reduce these emissions by another 50%.
This will result in 2030 absolute greenhouse gas emissions being 75% below our peak.
At the same time, we are also committed to a 30% reduction in our scope 3 emissions as we focus on making a positive impact throughout our supply chain.
Sustainability is core to our purpose and will continue to be an important driver and differentiator for our company moving forward.
As Brian commented, Owens Corning delivered outstanding financial results in the first quarter.
Strong top line growth, 400 basis points of gross margin expansion and continued operating expense discipline drove record first quarter adjusted EBIT, along with an adjusted EBIT margin of 15%.
The stronger earnings, combined with a continued focus on working capital management and capital investments, resulted in healthy free cash flow generation in the quarter.
While benefiting from market conditions that are broadly stronger than they were a year ago, continued solid execution across the business was fundamental to driving this performance.
As anticipated, we're managing a more inflationary environment, primarily related to materials and transportation.
Positive price realization and manufacturing productivity more than offset the inflation headwind in the quarter.
Maintaining this positive balance remains a focus as we move through this inflationary environment.
Now turning to slide 5.
We can take a closer look at our results.
For the first quarter, we reported consolidated net sales of $1.9 billion, up 20% over 2020 with double-digit revenue growth in all 3 segments, reflecting the robust US residential housing market and the continued strengthening of commercial and industrial markets.
Adjusted EBIT for the first quarter of 2021 reached $282 million, up $166 million compared to the prior year and was highlighted by all 3 segments continuing to deliver double-digit EBIT margins.
Adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $183 million or $1.73 per diluted share compared to $67 million or $0.62 per diluted share in Q1 2020.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter was $119 million, up slightly compared to the prior year.
Our capital additions for the first quarter were $60 million, up $6 million as compared to Q1 2020.
We'll continue to be disciplined in our capital spending as we focus on delivering strong free cash flow and prioritizing investments that drive growth and productivity.
Slide 6 reconciles our first quarter adjusted EBIT of $282 million to our reported EBIT of $301 million.
During the quarter, we recognized $20 million of gains on the sale of certain precious metals.
Ongoing progress on our productivity initiatives and manufacturing process technology has enabled us to further modify the designs of our production tooling and reduce certain precious metal holdings.
In addition, we recorded $1 million of restructuring costs associated with the Insulation network optimization actions that we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2020.
These items are excluded from our adjusted first quarter EBIT.
Slide 7 provides a high-level overview of our first quarter adjusted EBIT comparing 2021 to 2020.
Adjusted EBIT of $282 million was a new first quarter record for the company and increased $166 million over the prior year.
Roofing and Insulation more than doubled their EBIT and Composites grew by 80%.
Before turning to the review of each of our businesses, I want to speak to the onetime financial impacts we had from the winter storms in February.
Each of our businesses faced operational disruptions related to the storms.
However, these were offset in each of the businesses by gains on renewable energy settlements.
As we discussed at the time of our year-end call, these impacts were contemplated in our first quarter guidance.
Now, turning to Slide 8.
I'll provide more details on the performance of each of the businesses.
The Insulation business executed well to deliver strong growth on both the top and bottom lines.
Sales for the quarter were $700 million, a 16% increase over first quarter 2020.
We saw volume strength across the business as US new construction continued to be robust, and many of the commercial end markets we serve globally continue to strengthen.
In North American residential Fiberglas Insulation, we continue to ship all we can produce as the US new residential market remains very healthy.
We saw volumes up in line with the expectations we had at the time of our last call and continue to see positive pricing as a result of the actions that we've taken over the past three quarters.
I'm happy to share that we started up our batts and rolls lines in Kansas City in February and continued to ramp up production as we move through the quarter.
In technical and other insulation, we saw volume up across the business with our highly specified products, continuing to see growth in demand in North America and Europe.
Pricing continues to be stable, and we saw a benefit from currency translation in the quarter.
For the Insulation business overall, good execution in our manufacturing operations partially offset continued transportation headwinds and accelerating material inflation.
We delivered margins of 12% and EBIT of $82 million more than double the $39 million of EBIT in the first quarter of last year.
The Composites business had a strong start to the year.
Sales for the first quarter were $559 million, up 13% compared to the prior year.
Stronger-than-expected volume growth in the quarter resulted from demand for downstream applications serving the building and construction and wind markets as well as demand in key geographies where our local supply for local demand model is being valued by customers and drove higher volumes compared to the prior year.
We also saw positive price realization in Composites, resulting from our most recent contract negotiations and the strength of the markets.
Operationally, solid manufacturing performance offset headwinds from material and transportation inflation.
For the quarter, Composites delivered $79 million of EBIT and EBIT margin of 14%.
Slide 10 provides an overview of our Roofing business.
The Roofing business produced its strongest first quarter top and bottom line performance as we continue to operate in a sold-out environment.
Sales in the first quarter were $711 million, up 28% compared to the prior year.
The US asphalt shingle market grew 26% for the quarter as compared to the prior year with our US shingle volumes, slightly outperforming the market.
We're seeing strong realization on our announced price increases and price costs remained positive as asphalt deflation continued to narrow through the quarter, and we started to face into transportation inflation.
Similar to the other 2 businesses, strong manufacturing performance was a fundamental element of the Roofing business results.
For the quarter, EBIT was $156 million, up $92 million from the prior year, achieving 22% EBIT margins.
Turning to Slide 11.
I'll discuss significant financial highlights for the first quarter and full year 2021, continued discipline around management of working capital, operating expenses and capital investments resulted in strong cash flow.
In addition, we didn't experience the seasonal working capital build that we typically see in the first quarter of the year due to robust demand across our businesses.
Free cash flow for the first quarter of 2021 at $120 million, up $264 million compared to the first quarter of 2020.
It was a record for a first quarter.
During the first quarter of 2021, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of our common stock and returned $197 million of cash to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends.
With the strong cash performance and last year's deleveraging activities, we maintain a solid investment-grade balance sheet and are operating within our target debt to adjusted EBITDA range with ample liquidity.
At quarter end, the company had liquidity of approximately $1.7 billion, consisting of $605 million of cash and nearly $1.1 billion of combined availability on our bank debt facilities.
We remain focused on consistently generating strong free cash flow, returning at least 50% to investors over time and maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet.
Now, turning to 2021 outlook for key financial items.
I'll point out that there are no changes from our initial outlook provided in February.
General corporate expenses are expected to range between $135 million and $145 million.
Capital additions are expected to be approximately $460 million, which is below expected depreciation and amortization of approximately $480 million.
We continue to focus on opportunities to support our businesses at a sustained lower level of capital intensity over time.
Interest expense is estimated to be between $120 million and $130 million.
And we expect our 2021 effective tax rate to be 26% to 28% of adjusted pre-tax earnings and our cash tax rate to be 18% to 20% of adjusted pre-tax earnings.
We're closely monitoring potential changes to the US tax landscape and will be proactive to mitigate the long-term effect on our cash tax rate.
Our first quarter performance provided a strong start to the year.
As we look forward, we expect the US residential repair and remodeling and new construction end markets to remain robust with our commercial and industrial markets continuing to strengthen.
While the COVID-19 pandemic continues to create market uncertainty, our teams are performing at a high level, producing results that demonstrate the earnings power of our company and position us well to continue building on this outstanding performance.
Given the strength of our key markets and our continued operational performance, we expect the company to generate another quarter of significant revenue and earnings growth in the second quarter versus prior year.
Consistent with prior practice, I'll focus my business outlook comments on our expectations for Q2.
In each business, we expect prior year comparisons to be impacted by pandemic-related market responses, which affected our production and volume shipments last year.
Starting with Insulation, we continue to see strength in new U.S. residential construction.
Given the decline in North American residential Fiberglas Insulation shipments last year during the second quarter, we expect those sea shipments to grow about 25%, with pricing continuing to improve from realization of our April increase.
Given our outlook for inflation, we have also recently announced an 8% price increase effective June 28.
In our technical and other building insulation businesses, we are seeing volumes recover to pre-COVID levels.
In the second quarter, we expect our volumes to be up mid-teens as we see increasing demand for our products in global building and construction applications.
Pricing in these businesses is expected to remain relatively stable to slightly up.
In terms of inflation, we expect material and transportation cost increases we faced in Q1 to continue in a more meaningful way in the current quarter, partially offset by ongoing strong manufacturing productivity.
Additionally, we anticipate benefits of approximately $30 million from better fixed cost absorption on higher production volumes.
Given all this, we expect EBIT margins to improve sequentially, approaching mid-teens for the quarter.
Moving on to Composites; we expect our volume growth to continue at a strong pace, up approximately 30% versus the prior year.
Pricing is also expected to improve low to mid-single digits year-over-year.
Margins should benefit from the reversal of roughly $30 million of curtailment cost we saw in the second quarter of 2020.
Consistent with the broader industry trend, inflation will represent a more meaningful headwind for the business, which we would expect to partially offset through productivity gains.
On a sequential basis, EBIT margins in Q2 are expected to be similar to the first quarter.
And in Roofing, we expect the market to be up between 15% and 20%, with our volumes up mid to high single digits.
We anticipate our volume growth will trail the market growth due to the strength of our shipments in Q2 of last year.
Roofing pricing is expected to improve with the announced increase of 5% to 7% that was effective at the beginning of this month.
From an inflation standpoint, we expect to face more significant headwinds in asphalt cost and other material inputs, particularly resin used in our components business.
Given this, we have recently announced an additional price increase of 4% to 6% effective in mid-June.
Overall, we expect EBIT margins to increase sequentially from Q1, approaching mid-20%.
With that view of our businesses, I'll turn to a few key enterprise areas.
Our team remains committed to generating strong operating and free cash flow.
In terms of capital allocation, our priorities remain focused on reinvesting in our business, especially productivity and organic growth initiatives.
Returning at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases and maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet.
In addition, we are also evaluating investments in bolt-on acquisitions that leverage our commercial, operational and geographic strengths and expand our building and construction product offering.
Overall, we are well positioned to capitalize on near-term market opportunities as well as several longer-term secular trends that provide multiyear growth opportunities, including the demand for new housing in the US which has been underbuilt for several years and continued remodeling investments as homeowners renovate their living spaces and upgrade their homes.
We are also seeing growing opportunities to benefit from the drive for increased energy efficiency in homes and buildings, a greater importance being placed on sustainability and material durability and additional investments being made in renewable energy and infrastructure.
Each of tease trends creates opportunities for Owens Corning to leverage our material science, building science and unique product and process technologies to partner with our customers and help them grow with additional products, systems and services.
As I noted at the beginning of today's call, our team is proud of the outstanding operational and financial performance we delivered in the first quarter and are excited by the opportunities we have to grow our company, help our customers win in the market and deliver value to our shareholders.

As Brian commented, Owens Corning delivered outstanding financial results in the first quarter.
Strong top line growth, 400 basis points of gross margin expansion and continued operating expense discipline drove record first quarter adjusted EBIT, along with an adjusted EBIT margin of 15%.
The stronger earnings, combined with a continued focus on working capital management and capital investments, resulted in healthy free cash flow generation in the quarter.
While benefiting from market conditions that are broadly stronger than they were a year ago, continued solid execution across the business was fundamental to driving this performance.
As anticipated, we're managing a more inflationary environment, primarily related to materials and transportation.
Positive price realization and manufacturing productivity more than offset the inflation headwind in the quarter.
Maintaining this positive balance remains a focus as we move through this inflationary environment.
Now turning to slide 5.
We can take a closer look at our results.
For the first quarter, we reported consolidated net sales of $1.9 billion, up 20% over 2020 with double-digit revenue growth in all 3 segments, reflecting the robust US residential housing market and the continued strengthening of commercial and industrial markets.
Adjusted EBIT for the first quarter of 2021 reached $282 million, up $166 million compared to the prior year and was highlighted by all 3 segments continuing to deliver double-digit EBIT margins.
Adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $183 million or $1.73 per diluted share compared to $67 million or $0.62 per diluted share in Q1 2020.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter was $119 million, up slightly compared to the prior year.
Our capital additions for the first quarter were $60 million, up $6 million as compared to Q1 2020.
We'll continue to be disciplined in our capital spending as we focus on delivering strong free cash flow and prioritizing investments that drive growth and productivity.
Slide 6 reconciles our first quarter adjusted EBIT of $282 million to our reported EBIT of $301 million.
During the quarter, we recognized $20 million of gains on the sale of certain precious metals.
Ongoing progress on our productivity initiatives and manufacturing process technology has enabled us to further modify the designs of our production tooling and reduce certain precious metal holdings.
In addition, we recorded $1 million of restructuring costs associated with the Insulation network optimization actions that we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2020.
These items are excluded from our adjusted first quarter EBIT.
Slide 7 provides a high-level overview of our first quarter adjusted EBIT comparing 2021 to 2020.
Adjusted EBIT of $282 million was a new first quarter record for the company and increased $166 million over the prior year.
Roofing and Insulation more than doubled their EBIT and Composites grew by 80%.
Before turning to the review of each of our businesses, I want to speak to the onetime financial impacts we had from the winter storms in February.
Each of our businesses faced operational disruptions related to the storms.
However, these were offset in each of the businesses by gains on renewable energy settlements.
As we discussed at the time of our year-end call, these impacts were contemplated in our first quarter guidance.
Now, turning to Slide 8.
I'll provide more details on the performance of each of the businesses.
The Insulation business executed well to deliver strong growth on both the top and bottom lines.
Sales for the quarter were $700 million, a 16% increase over first quarter 2020.
We saw volume strength across the business as US new construction continued to be robust, and many of the commercial end markets we serve globally continue to strengthen.
In North American residential Fiberglas Insulation, we continue to ship all we can produce as the US new residential market remains very healthy.
We saw volumes up in line with the expectations we had at the time of our last call and continue to see positive pricing as a result of the actions that we've taken over the past three quarters.
I'm happy to share that we started up our batts and rolls lines in Kansas City in February and continued to ramp up production as we move through the quarter.
In technical and other insulation, we saw volume up across the business with our highly specified products, continuing to see growth in demand in North America and Europe.
Pricing continues to be stable, and we saw a benefit from currency translation in the quarter.
For the Insulation business overall, good execution in our manufacturing operations partially offset continued transportation headwinds and accelerating material inflation.
We delivered margins of 12% and EBIT of $82 million more than double the $39 million of EBIT in the first quarter of last year.
The Composites business had a strong start to the year.
Sales for the first quarter were $559 million, up 13% compared to the prior year.
Stronger-than-expected volume growth in the quarter resulted from demand for downstream applications serving the building and construction and wind markets as well as demand in key geographies where our local supply for local demand model is being valued by customers and drove higher volumes compared to the prior year.
We also saw positive price realization in Composites, resulting from our most recent contract negotiations and the strength of the markets.
Operationally, solid manufacturing performance offset headwinds from material and transportation inflation.
For the quarter, Composites delivered $79 million of EBIT and EBIT margin of 14%.
Slide 10 provides an overview of our Roofing business.
The Roofing business produced its strongest first quarter top and bottom line performance as we continue to operate in a sold-out environment.
Sales in the first quarter were $711 million, up 28% compared to the prior year.
The US asphalt shingle market grew 26% for the quarter as compared to the prior year with our US shingle volumes, slightly outperforming the market.
We're seeing strong realization on our announced price increases and price costs remained positive as asphalt deflation continued to narrow through the quarter, and we started to face into transportation inflation.
Similar to the other 2 businesses, strong manufacturing performance was a fundamental element of the Roofing business results.
For the quarter, EBIT was $156 million, up $92 million from the prior year, achieving 22% EBIT margins.
Turning to Slide 11.
I'll discuss significant financial highlights for the first quarter and full year 2021, continued discipline around management of working capital, operating expenses and capital investments resulted in strong cash flow.
In addition, we didn't experience the seasonal working capital build that we typically see in the first quarter of the year due to robust demand across our businesses.
Free cash flow for the first quarter of 2021 at $120 million, up $264 million compared to the first quarter of 2020.
It was a record for a first quarter.
During the first quarter of 2021, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of our common stock and returned $197 million of cash to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends.
With the strong cash performance and last year's deleveraging activities, we maintain a solid investment-grade balance sheet and are operating within our target debt to adjusted EBITDA range with ample liquidity.
At quarter end, the company had liquidity of approximately $1.7 billion, consisting of $605 million of cash and nearly $1.1 billion of combined availability on our bank debt facilities.
We remain focused on consistently generating strong free cash flow, returning at least 50% to investors over time and maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet.
Now, turning to 2021 outlook for key financial items.
I'll point out that there are no changes from our initial outlook provided in February.
General corporate expenses are expected to range between $135 million and $145 million.
Capital additions are expected to be approximately $460 million, which is below expected depreciation and amortization of approximately $480 million.
We continue to focus on opportunities to support our businesses at a sustained lower level of capital intensity over time.
Interest expense is estimated to be between $120 million and $130 million.
And we expect our 2021 effective tax rate to be 26% to 28% of adjusted pre-tax earnings and our cash tax rate to be 18% to 20% of adjusted pre-tax earnings.
We're closely monitoring potential changes to the US tax landscape and will be proactive to mitigate the long-term effect on our cash tax rate.
Our first quarter performance provided a strong start to the year.
As we look forward, we expect the US residential repair and remodeling and new construction end markets to remain robust with our commercial and industrial markets continuing to strengthen.
While the COVID-19 pandemic continues to create market uncertainty, our teams are performing at a high level, producing results that demonstrate the earnings power of our company and position us well to continue building on this outstanding performance.
Given the strength of our key markets and our continued operational performance, we expect the company to generate another quarter of significant revenue and earnings growth in the second quarter versus prior year.
Consistent with prior practice, I'll focus my business outlook comments on our expectations for Q2.
In each business, we expect prior year comparisons to be impacted by pandemic-related market responses, which affected our production and volume shipments last year.
Starting with Insulation, we continue to see strength in new U.S. residential construction.
Given the decline in North American residential Fiberglas Insulation shipments last year during the second quarter, we expect those sea shipments to grow about 25%, with pricing continuing to improve from realization of our April increase.
Given our outlook for inflation, we have also recently announced an 8% price increase effective June 28.
In our technical and other building insulation businesses, we are seeing volumes recover to pre-COVID levels.
In the second quarter, we expect our volumes to be up mid-teens as we see increasing demand for our products in global building and construction applications.
Pricing in these businesses is expected to remain relatively stable to slightly up.
In terms of inflation, we expect material and transportation cost increases we faced in Q1 to continue in a more meaningful way in the current quarter, partially offset by ongoing strong manufacturing productivity.
Additionally, we anticipate benefits of approximately $30 million from better fixed cost absorption on higher production volumes.
Given all this, we expect EBIT margins to improve sequentially, approaching mid-teens for the quarter.
Moving on to Composites; we expect our volume growth to continue at a strong pace, up approximately 30% versus the prior year.
Pricing is also expected to improve low to mid-single digits year-over-year.
Margins should benefit from the reversal of roughly $30 million of curtailment cost we saw in the second quarter of 2020.
Consistent with the broader industry trend, inflation will represent a more meaningful headwind for the business, which we would expect to partially offset through productivity gains.
On a sequential basis, EBIT margins in Q2 are expected to be similar to the first quarter.
And in Roofing, we expect the market to be up between 15% and 20%, with our volumes up mid to high single digits.
We anticipate our volume growth will trail the market growth due to the strength of our shipments in Q2 of last year.
Roofing pricing is expected to improve with the announced increase of 5% to 7% that was effective at the beginning of this month.
From an inflation standpoint, we expect to face more significant headwinds in asphalt cost and other material inputs, particularly resin used in our components business.
Given this, we have recently announced an additional price increase of 4% to 6% effective in mid-June.
Overall, we expect EBIT margins to increase sequentially from Q1, approaching mid-20%.
With that view of our businesses, I'll turn to a few key enterprise areas.
Our team remains committed to generating strong operating and free cash flow.
In terms of capital allocation, our priorities remain focused on reinvesting in our business, especially productivity and organic growth initiatives.
Returning at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases and maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet.
In addition, we are also evaluating investments in bolt-on acquisitions that leverage our commercial, operational and geographic strengths and expand our building and construction product offering.
Overall, we are well positioned to capitalize on near-term market opportunities as well as several longer-term secular trends that provide multiyear growth opportunities, including the demand for new housing in the US which has been underbuilt for several years and continued remodeling investments as homeowners renovate their living spaces and upgrade their homes.
We are also seeing growing opportunities to benefit from the drive for increased energy efficiency in homes and buildings, a greater importance being placed on sustainability and material durability and additional investments being made in renewable energy and infrastructure.
Each of tease trends creates opportunities for Owens Corning to leverage our material science, building science and unique product and process technologies to partner with our customers and help them grow with additional products, systems and services.
As I noted at the beginning of today's call, our team is proud of the outstanding operational and financial performance we delivered in the first quarter and are excited by the opportunities we have to grow our company, help our customers win in the market and deliver value to our shareholders.

Now as we normally do, before we start, we need to read our cautionary statement.
Now on to our report.
I am pleased to share that Watsco has delivered an incredible second quarter, achieving new records in virtually every performance metric.
Earnings per share jumped 64% to a record $3.71 per share on a 66% increase in net income.
This was by far our most successful quarter ever.
Sales grew 36% or nearly $500 million to a record $1.85 billion in sales for the quarter.
Gross profits increased 50% with gross margins expanding 220 basis points.
Operating income increased $88 million or 68% to $217 million.
And operating margins, this is a big one, operating margins expanded 220 basis points to a record 11.7%.
Now these results are all the more positive when considered against last year's second quarter, which had only a modest impact from the COVID-related slowdowns.
Now we have two new companies in our family, TEC and Acme.
They performed very well, and we cannot be happier that they are now part of an important part of Watsco.
They have a rich and successful history and we will help them any way we can.
Looking ahead, we are engaged in a very fragmented $50 billion North American market.
Again, this is a $50 billion North American market.
And we hope to find more great companies to join us.
Greater scale in this industry provides more capital for us to fund our growth priorities.
Also Watsco's industry-leading technologies continues to gain traction, and we believe they are helping us gain market share.
Here are a few important highlights to mention.
First, growth rates among active users of our technologies continues to outpace the growth rates of nonusers.
Customers using our technology are simply growing faster.
Next, attrition among customers using our technology is meaningfully lower compared to nonusers.
The technology enables us to create stickier customer relationships.
Also, more customers are using our digital selling platforms that are called OnCall Air and CreditForComfort.
They help and modernize how HV solutions are presented to homeowners.
These tools have also benefited the sale of higher efficiency systems, which we think is an important contributor to the climate chain discussion.
As older systems are replaced, our technology can play an important role in helping consumers choose more energy-efficient solutions.
Our progress is very encouraging, but we believe it is still early in terms of reaching the full potential of our technology investments.
Our focus remains in the long term.
I think you've heard me say that over and over again.
We are long-term players in the industry.
Please feel free to schedule a Zoom call with us, and we can further explain our technology and its impact.
Finally, but very important, our balance sheet remains in pristine condition with only a small amount of debt.
We have plenty of capacity and even more ambitions to grow our company both organically and through acquisitions.

2,"On the call are Jeff Mezger, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Matt Mandino and Rob McGibney, Executive Vice Presidents and Co-Chief Operating Officers; Jeff Kaminski Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Bill Hollinger, Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and Thad Johnson, Senior Vice President and Treasurer.
And with that, here's Jeff Mezger.
Our performance in the third quarter reflected significant year-over-year increases across the majority of our key metrics as we produced solid results in housing market, experiencing great demand, while also facing industrywide challenges in getting homes completed and delivered.
These results will help drive our returns focused growth as we continue to expand our scale, while generating a higher return on equity.
Before I get into the highlights for the quarter and there are many, I want to address our shortfall in deliveries and revenues.
Disruptions to our supply chain intensified as the quarter progressed and along with municipal delays resulted in our build times extending by about two weeks sequentially.
This pushed many deliveries into our fourth quarter and will similarly delayed some fourth quarter deliveries into our 2022 first quarter.
We are taking aggressive steps to manage through these delays, including expanding our subcontractor base, partnering with our national suppliers and simplifying our products to stabilize our build times.
We produced total revenues of $1.47 billion, up nearly 50% as compared to the prior year period and diluted earnings per share of $1.60.
We achieved an operating income margin of 12.1% excluding inventory related charges, which grew 250 basis points year-over-year, driving a 40% expansion in our profitability per unit to nearly 52,000.
This was accomplished even with the leverage we lost from the delayed deliveries.
Our related gross margin of 22% was a particular highlight and demonstrates that we are effectively managing pace, price and starts to optimize each asset.
As to capital allocation, we continue to take a balanced approach with disciplined investments in growth remaining our top priority.
In the third quarter, we invested about $780 million in land acquisition and development.
We expanded our lot position to almost 81,000 lots owned or controlled, with our inventory continuing to rotate into a higher quality portfolio of communities.
In addition to these investments, we returned a significant amount of cash to stockholders through both our regular quarterly cash dividend and the repurchase of $188 million of our stock.
These repurchases will further enhance our return on equity in 2022 beyond this year's expected 20% level, especially when combined with our projected increase in scale to over $7 billion in revenue and higher operating and gross margins.
Since we embarked on our returns focused growth strategy, we have produced meaningful expansion in our ROE.
While we recognized that returns across the industry have expanded, our rate of improvement is meaningful and we believe our return on equity in the low to mid 20% range is sustainable.
During the quarter, we announced the promotion of Rob McGibney to Executive Vice President and Co-Chief Operating Officer, a role he shares with Matt Mandino.
We created a Co-COO structure with two simple objectives in mind: to accelerate the profitable growth of our business in order to drive increasing returns on equity and to enhance our execution.
Rob is responsible for our West Coast and Southwest regions and Matt is responsible for our Central and Southeast regions.
In addition to their regional responsibilities, Matt and Rob each have oversight of key strategic corporate functions as well.
The operating environment within our industry has become more complex over the past 18 months, given the supply chain issues and municipal delays that I mentioned earlier and their impact on build times.
Having two proven leaders running our operations, will allow for a more hands on approach that is geographically focused, enabling greater day-to-day collaboration with our regional and division leadership.
We successfully opened over 40 new communities in the third quarter, marking the start of a sequential improvement in ending community count that we anticipate will continue over each of the next five quarters.
With the strong and growing lot pipeline that I referenced, driving an acceleration in new communities, we expect to expand our community count to roughly 260 by year-end 2022.
Our monthly absorption per community accelerated to 6.6 net orders during the third quarter from 5.9 in the year ago quarter and reflecting a more typical seasonal pattern sequentially, while remaining at historically elevated level.
Net orders were 4,085, represented a small decline year-over-year, against the strong results in the prior year quarter.
However, with our actions in taking price and moderating pace, our net order value was up more than 20% year-over-year.
We continue to manage our selling pace to production, limiting our lot releases to prevent our backlog from getting over extended and started over 4,000 homes during the quarter.
This compares to starts in the year-ago quarter of about 3,400.
We currently have approximately 9,000 homes in production with 93% of these homes already sold.
Only 240 of these homes are unsold past the foundation stage and our focus right now is on compression our build times to deliver our backlog.
With the rise in our net order value to $2 billion, we are laying the foundation for future margin growth.
Our pricing power is solid, while our pace remain strong and the demand for our homes at higher prices tells us that our price points remain attainable.
The credit profile of our buyers is above our historical level with an average FICO score of 7.31 and down payment of 14%, translating to almost $60,000, which is noteworthy for our first time buyer.
In addition, the internal indicators that we monitor for changes in customer behavior, including the square footage of homes purchased or spending in our design studios remain stable.
Our backlog now stands at roughly 10,700 homes, representing future revenues of over $4.8 billion.
Our backlog value is up nearly 90% year-over-year with significantly higher margins within this backlog.
This is an excellent position from which to finish 2021 and support another year of growth in revenues and expansion of margins in 2022.
Homeownership remains compelling and attainable and we believe the drivers are in place to support healthy market conditions for the foreseeable future.
An insufficient level of supply exist at our price points to meet the demand for millennials and Gen Zs, which together number roughly $140 million.
These two cohorts value the personalization and choice in our built-to-order business model, which is a significant factor in why our absorption rates have consistently been among the highest in the industry.
This together with our experience in serving first time buyers, who represent 61% of our deliveries in the third quarter, has us well positioned to capture demand going forward.
Switching gears for a moment.
I want to highlight our recent achievement in sustainability.
KB Home received a record 25 ENERGY STAR Market Leader Awards from the EPA, further demonstrating our leadership position as the most energy efficient national homebuilder.
We are proud to continue moving our environmental program forward, which is helping to lower the total cost of homeownership for our buyers, while doing our part to reduce the carbon footprint of our homes.
We have a remarkable team that is focused on execution and committed to customer service.
In closing, we are growing into a bigger business that is operating at meaningfully higher margins and generating considerably improved returns.
We anticipate a return on equity this year of about 20% and further expansion in 2022, supported by double-digit growth in revenues and community count, with higher margins, as well as our recent share repurchase.
Beyond next year, we believe our return on equity is sustainable in a low to mid 20% range.
I will now review highlights of our financial performance for the 2021 third quarter, discuss our current outlook for the fourth quarter and summarize expected improvements in several 2022 metrics.
In the third quarter, we produced measurable year-over-year improvements in nearly all our key metrics, including a 49% increase in housing revenues that drove a 93% expansion in our earnings per diluted share.
We also made substantial investments in land and land development to support continued growth and completed a significant share repurchase that among other things will enhance future returns and per share earnings.
Our housing revenues grew to $1.46 billion for the quarter from $979 million for the prior year period.
This improvement reflected a 35% increase in the number of homes delivered and an 11% rise in our overall average selling price.
As Jeff discussed, our current quarter deliveries were tampered by industry wide building material shortages and labor constraints that extended build times in most of our served markets.
We anticipate similar challenges will apply to our fourth quarter and have considered these factors in our outlook.
Our ending backlog value expanded 89% to over $4.8 billion, driven by strong increases in each of our four regions.
Considering our quarter-end backlog, the status of our homes under construction and expected construction cycle times, we anticipate our fourth quarter housing revenues will be in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.75 billion.
In the third quarter, our overall average selling price of homes delivered rose to approximately $427,000 from approximately $385,000, reflecting the strength of the housing market.
For the fourth quarter, we are projecting an overall average selling price of approximately $450,000, which would represent a year-over-year increase of 9%.
Our third quarter homebuilding operating income improved to $169.9 million as compared to $88.9 million in the year-earlier quarter.
Operating income margin increased 270 basis points to 11.6% due to improvements in both our gross profit margin and SG&A expense ratio.
Excluding inventory related charges of $6.7 million in the current quarter and $6.9 million in the year-earlier quarter, our operating margin was up 250 basis points year-over-year to 12.1%.
For the fourth quarter, we expect our homebuilding operating income margin, excluding the impact of any inventory related charges, will be approximately 11.8% compared to 10.7% in the year-earlier quarter.
Our housing gross profit margin for the quarter was 21.5%, up 160 basis points from 19.9% for the prior year period.
This margin expansion mainly reflecting a favorable selling price environment supported by healthy housing market dynamics and lower amortization of capitalized interest.
Excluding inventory related charges, our margin for the quarter was up 140 basis points year-over-year to 22%.
Our adjusted housing gross profit margin, which excludes inventory related charges, as well as the amortization of previously capitalized interest was 24.5% for the third quarter compared to 23.7% for the same 2020 period.
Assuming no inventory related charges, we believe our fourth quarter housing gross profit margins will be in the range of 21.6% to 22%, reflecting the impact of peak lumber prices when our forecasted fourth quarter whole deliveries were started.
Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio of 9.9% for the quarter improved by 110 basis points as compared to 11% for the 2020 third quarter, primarily due to increased operating leverage, partly offset by higher costs associated with performance-based employee compensation plans and additional resources to support growth.
As we position our business for growth in 2022 housing revenues, we believe that our fourth quarter SG&A expense ratio will remain roughly the same as the second and third quarters of this year or approximately 10%.
This would represent an improvement from 10.3% in the 2020 fourth quarter.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 14%, reflecting $24.1 million of income tax expense, net of $21.5 million of federal energy tax credits.
We expect our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter to be approximately 24% including a small favorable impact from energy tax credits compared to approximately 16% for the year-earlier period.
Overall, we reported net income for the third quarter of $150.1 million or $1.60 per diluted share, compared to $78.4 million or $0.83 per diluted share for the prior year period.
Turning now to community count, our third quarter average of 205 decreased 14% from the year-earlier quarter.
We ended the quarter with 210 communities open for sales, as compared to 232 communities at the end of the 2020 third quarter.
On a sequential basis, as anticipated, we were up 10 communities from the end of the second quarter.
We are planning to achieve continued sequential quarterly increases in our community count through 2022.
We believe our 2021 year-end community count will be up slightly from the third quarter, resulting in a high single-digit decrease in the average fourth quarter count as compared to the prior year.
We invested $779 million in land, land development and fees during the third quarter with $467 million or 60% of the total representing new land acquisitions.
In the first three quarters of this year, we invested $1 billion to acquire over 16,000 lots.
We ended the quarter with a strong supply of nearly 81,000 lots owned and controlled, then we expect to drive a significant number of new community openings and steady growth in community count.
At quarter end, we had total liquidity of over $1.1 billion, including $350 million of cash and $791 million available under our unsecured revolving credit facility.
In early June, we issued $390 million of 4.00% 10-year senior notes and used a portion of the net proceeds to redeem approximately $270 million of tendered 7.00% senior notes due December 15, 2021.
We recognized a $5.1 million loss on this early redemption of debt in the third quarter.
The remaining $180 million of the 7% senior notes, we redeemed as senior notes, partially offset by the new issuance, will result in annualized interest savings of nearly $16 million, contributing to our continued trend of lowering the interest amortization included in our housing gross profit margins.
In addition, we see the $350 million maturity in September 2022 of 7.5% senior notes as an another opportunity to reduce incurred interest and enhance future gross margins.
During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.7 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $188.2 million.
The shares repurchased represented approximately 5% of total outstanding shares and will drive an incremental improvement in our earnings per share and return on equity going forward.
For purchases of calculating diluted earnings per share, we estimate a weighted average share count of $91 million for the 2021 fourth quarter and $93.5 million for the full year.
For 2022, we are forecasting housing revenues of over $7 billion, supported by our anticipated 2021 year-end backlog, community count growth and an ongoing strong demand environment throughout next year.
We expect approximately 200 new community openings over the next five quarters to drive sequential increases in ending community count.
Consistent with the forecasted double-digit growth that we have discussed during the past two quarters, we believe our 2022 year-end community count will be up about 20% year-over-year and the full year average count will be about 10% higher as compared to 2021.
We also believe that gross margin expansion to a level above our guidance for next quarter, along with improvement in the SG&A expense ratio, will result in a measurable year-over-year increase in operating margin.
Further, the anticipated increase in scale combined with a higher operating margin and the benefit of the recent share repurchase, should drive a meaningful improvement in return on equity relative to be approximately 20% expected for 2021.
In summary, we believe we are well positioned to achieve our targets for the both 2021 fourth quarter and 2022 fiscal year.
Our forecasted 2021 full year results represent significant improvements across virtually all our key metrics with notable increases in our scale, absorption pace, housing gross margin and operating margin.
In addition, we are particularly pleased with the forecast expansion in our full year return on equity and our anticipated further improvement in 2022.
We believe our ongoing focus on accelerating profitable growth and expanding our returns by leveraging our larger scale, attractive inventory profile and uniquely compelling built-to-order business model, will produce measurable enhancements in both book and stockholder value in future periods.

The summary of the call transcript is below:
Jeff Mezger, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Our performance in the third quarter reflected significant year-over-year increases across the majority of our key metrics as we produced solid results in housing market, experiencing great demand, while also facing industrywide challenges in getting homes completed and delivered. These results will help drive our returns focused growth as we continue to expand our scale, while generating a higher return on equity. Before I get into the highlights for the quarter and there are many, I want to address our shortfall in deliveries and revenues. Disruptions to our supply chain intensified as the quarter progressed and along with municipal delays resulted in our build times extending by about two weeks sequentially. This pushed many deliveries into our fourth quarter and will similarly delayed some fourth quarter deliveries into our 2022 first quarter. We are taking aggressive steps to manage through these delays, including expanding our subcontractor base, partnering with our national suppliers and simplifying our products to stabilize our build times. We produced total revenues of $1.47 billion, up nearly 50% as compared to the prior year period and diluted earnings per share of $1.60. We achieved an operating income margin of 12.1% excluding inventory related charges, which grew 250 basis points year-over-year, driving a 40% expansion in our profitability per unit to nearly 52,000. This was accomplished even with the leverage we lost from the delayed deliveries. Our related gross margin of 22% was a particular highlight and demonstrates that we are effectively managing pace, price and starts to optimize each asset. As to capital allocation, we continue to take a balanced approach with disciplined investments in growth remaining our top priority. In the third quarter, we invested about $780 million in land acquisition and development. We expanded our lot position to almost 81,000 lots owned or controlled, with our inventory continuing to rotate into a higher quality portfolio of communities. In addition to these investments, we returned a significant amount of cash to stockholders through both our regular quarterly cash dividend and the repurchase of $188 million of our stock. These repurchases will further enhance our return on equity in 2022 beyond this year's expected 20% level, especially when combined with our projected increase in scale to over $7 billion in revenue and higher operating and gross margins. Since we embarked on our returns focused growth strategy, we have produced meaningful expansion in our ROE. While we recognized that returns across the industry have expanded, our rate of improvement is meaningful and we believe our return on equity in the low to mid 20% range is sustainable. During the quarter, we announced the promotion of Rob McGibney to Executive Vice President and Co-Chief Operating Officer, a role he shares with Matt Mandino. We created a Co-COO structure with two simple objectives in mind: to accelerate the profitable growth of our business in order to drive increasing returns on equity and to enhance our execution. Rob is responsible for our West Coast and Southwest regions and Matt is responsible for our Central and Southeast regions. In addition to their regional responsibilities, Matt and Rob each have oversight of key strategic corporate functions as well. The operating environment within our industry has become more complex over the past 18 months, given the supply chain issues and municipal delays that I mentioned earlier and their impact on build times. Having two proven leaders running our operations, will allow for a more hands on approach that is geographically focused, enabling greater day-to-day collaboration with our regional and division leadership. We successfully opened over 40 new communities in the third quarter, marking the start of a sequential improvement in ending community count that we anticipate will continue over each of the next five quarters. With the strong and growing lot pipeline that I referenced, driving an acceleration in new communities, we expect to expand our community count to roughly 260 by year-end 2022. Our monthly absorption per community accelerated to 6.6 net orders during the third quarter from 5.9 in the year ago quarter and reflecting a more typical seasonal pattern sequentially, while remaining at historically elevated level. Net orders were 4,085, represented a small decline year-over-year, against the strong results in the prior year quarter. However, with our actions in taking price and moderating pace, our net order value was up more than 20% year-over-year. We continue to manage our selling pace to production, limiting our lot releases to prevent our backlog from getting over extended and started over 4,000 homes during the quarter. This compares to starts in the year-ago quarter of about 3,400. We currently have approximately 9,000 homes in production with 93% of these homes already sold.

And with that, here's Jeff Mezger.
Our performance in the third quarter reflected significant year-over-year increases across the majority of our key metrics as we produced solid results in housing market, experiencing great demand, while also facing industrywide challenges in getting homes completed and delivered.
These results will help drive our returns focused growth as we continue to expand our scale, while generating a higher return on equity.

Our monthly absorption per community accelerated to 6.6 net orders during the third quarter from 5.9 in the year ago quarter and reflecting a more typical seasonal pattern sequentially, while remaining at historically elevated level.
Net orders were 4,085, represented a small decline year-over-year, against the strong results in the prior year quarter.
However, with our actions in taking price and moderating pace, our net order value was up more than 20% year-over-year.
We continue to manage our selling pace to production, limiting our lot releases to prevent our backlog from getting over extended and started over 4,000 homes during the quarter.
This compares to starts in the year-ago quarter of about 3,400.
We currently have approximately 9,000 homes in production with 93% of these homes already sold.
Only 240 of these homes are unsold past the foundation stage and our focus right now is on compression our build times to deliver our backlog.
With the rise in our net order value to $2 billion, we are laying the foundation for future margin growth.
Our pricing power is solid, while our pace remain strong and the demand for our homes at higher prices tells us that our price points remain attainable.
The credit profile of our buyers is above our historical level with an average FICO score of 7.31 and down payment of 14%, translating to almost $60,000, which is noteworthy for our first time buyer.
In addition, the internal indicators that we monitor for changes in customer behavior, including the square footage of homes purchased or spending in our design studios remain stable.
Our backlog now stands at roughly 10,700 homes, representing future revenues of over $4.8 billion.
Our backlog value is up nearly 90% year-over-year with significantly higher margins within this backlog.
This is an excellent position from which to finish 2021 and support another year of growth in revenues and expansion of margins in 2022.
Homeownership remains compelling and attainable and we believe the drivers are in place to support healthy market conditions for the foreseeable future.
An insufficient level of supply exist at our price points to meet the demand for millennials and Gen Zs, which together number roughly $140 million.
These two cohorts value the personalization and choice in our built-to-order business model, which is a significant factor in why our absorption rates have consistently been among the highest in the industry.
This together with our experience in serving first time buyers, who represent 61% of our deliveries in the third quarter, has us well positioned to capture demand going forward.
Switching gears for a moment.
I want to highlight our recent achievement in sustainability.
KB Home received a record 25 ENERGY STAR Market Leader Awards from the EPA, further demonstrating our leadership position as the most energy efficient national homebuilder.
We are proud to continue moving our environmental program forward, which is helping to lower the total cost of homeownership for our buyers, while doing our part to reduce the carbon footprint of our homes.
We have a remarkable team that is focused on execution and committed to customer service.
In closing, we are growing into a bigger business that is operating at meaningfully higher margins and generating considerably improved returns.
We anticipate a return on equity this year of about 20% and further expansion in 2022, supported by double-digit growth in revenues and community count, with higher margins, as well as our recent share repurchase.
Beyond next year, we believe our return on equity is sustainable in a low to mid 20% range.
I will now review highlights of our financial performance for the 2021 third quarter, discuss our current outlook for the fourth quarter and summarize expected improvements in several 2022 metrics.
In the third quarter, we produced measurable year-over-year improvements in nearly all our key metrics, including a 49% increase in housing revenues that drove a 93% expansion in our earnings per diluted share.
We also made substantial investments in land and land development to support continued growth and completed a significant share repurchase that among other things will enhance future returns and per share earnings.
Our housing revenues grew to $1.46 billion for the quarter from $979 million for the prior year period.
This improvement reflected a 35% increase in the number of homes delivered and an 11% rise in our overall average selling price.
As Jeff discussed, our current quarter deliveries were tampered by industry wide building material shortages and labor constraints that extended build times in most of our served markets.
We anticipate similar challenges will apply to our fourth quarter and have considered these factors in our outlook.
Our ending backlog value expanded 89% to over $4.8 billion, driven by strong increases in each of our four regions.
Considering our quarter-end backlog, the status of our homes under construction and expected construction cycle times, we anticipate our fourth quarter housing revenues will be in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.75 billion.
In the third quarter, our overall average selling price of homes delivered rose to approximately $427,000 from approximately $385,000, reflecting the strength of the housing market.
For the fourth quarter, we are projecting an overall average selling price of approximately $450,000, which would represent a year-over-year increase of 9%.
Our third quarter homebuilding operating income improved to $169.9 million as compared to $88.9 million in the year-earlier quarter.
Operating income margin increased 270 basis points to 11.6% due to improvements in both our gross profit margin and SG&A expense ratio.
Excluding inventory related charges of $6.7 million in the current quarter and $6.9 million in the year-earlier quarter, our operating margin was up 250 basis points year-over-year to 12.1%.
For the fourth quarter, we expect our homebuilding operating income margin, excluding the impact of any inventory related charges, will be approximately 11.8% compared to 10.7% in the year-earlier quarter.
Our housing gross profit margin for the quarter was 21.5%, up 160 basis points from 19.9% for the prior year period.
This margin expansion mainly reflecting a favorable selling price environment supported by healthy housing market dynamics and lower amortization of capitalized interest.
Excluding inventory related charges, our margin for the quarter was up 140 basis points year-over-year to 22%.
Our adjusted housing gross profit margin, which excludes inventory related charges, as well as the amortization of previously capitalized interest was 24.5% for the third quarter compared to 23.7% for the same 2020 period.
Assuming no inventory related charges, we believe our fourth quarter housing gross profit margins will be in the range of 21.6% to 22%, reflecting the impact of peak lumber prices when our forecasted fourth quarter whole deliveries were started.
Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio of 9.9% for the quarter improved by 110 basis points as compared to 11% for the 2020 third quarter, primarily due to increased operating leverage, partly offset by higher costs associated with performance-based employee compensation plans and additional resources to support growth.
As we position our business for growth in 2022 housing revenues, we believe that our fourth quarter SG&A expense ratio will remain roughly the same as the second and third quarters of this year or approximately 10%.
This would represent an improvement from 10.3% in the 2020 fourth quarter.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 14%, reflecting $24.1 million of income tax expense, net of $21.5 million of federal energy tax credits.
We expect our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter to be approximately 24% including a small favorable impact from energy tax credits compared to approximately 16% for the year-earlier period.
Overall, we reported net income for the third quarter of $150.1 million or $1.60 per diluted share, compared to $78.4 million or $0.83 per diluted share for the prior year period.
Turning now to community count, our third quarter average of 205 decreased 14% from the year-earlier quarter.
We ended the quarter with 210 communities open for sales, as compared to 232 communities at the end of the 2020 third quarter.
On a sequential basis, as anticipated, we were up 10 communities from the end of the second quarter.
We are planning to achieve continued sequential quarterly increases in our community count through 2022.
We believe our 2021 year-end community count will be up slightly from the third quarter, resulting in a high single-digit decrease in the average fourth quarter count as compared to the prior year.
We invested $779 million in land, land development and fees during the third quarter with $467 million or 60% of the total representing new land acquisitions.
In the first three quarters of this year, we invested $1 billion to acquire over 16,000 lots.
We ended the quarter with a strong supply of nearly 81,000 lots owned and controlled, then we expect to drive a significant number of new community openings and steady growth in community count.
At quarter end, we had total liquidity of over $1.1 billion, including $350 million of cash and $791 million available under our unsecured revolving credit facility.
In early June, we issued $390 million of 4.00% 10-year senior notes and used a portion of the net proceeds to redeem approximately $270 million of tendered 7.00% senior notes due December 15, 2021.
We recognized a $5.1 million loss on this early redemption of debt in the third quarter.
The remaining $180 million of the 7% senior notes, we redeemed as senior notes, partially offset by the new issuance, will result in annualized interest savings of nearly $16 million, contributing to our continued trend of lowering the interest amortization included in our housing gross profit margins.
In addition, we see the $350 million maturity in September 2022 of 7.5% senior notes as an another opportunity to reduce incurred interest and enhance future gross margins.
During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.7 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $188.2 million.
The shares repurchased represented approximately 5% of total outstanding shares and will drive an incremental improvement in our earnings per share and return on equity going forward.
For purchases of calculating diluted earnings per share, we estimate a weighted average share count of $91 million for the 2021 fourth quarter and $93.5 million for the full year.
For 2022, we are forecasting housing revenues of over $7 billion, supported by our anticipated 2021 year-end backlog, community count growth and an ongoing strong demand environment throughout next year.
We expect approximately 200 new community openings over the next five quarters to drive sequential increases in ending community count.
Consistent with the forecasted double-digit growth that we have discussed during the past two quarters, we believe our 2022 year-end community count will be up about 20% year-over-year and the full year average count will be about 10% higher as compared to 2021.
We also believe that gross margin expansion to a level above our guidance for next quarter, along with improvement in the SG&A expense ratio, will result in a measurable year-over-year increase in operating margin.
Further, the anticipated increase in scale combined with a higher operating margin and the benefit of the recent share repurchase, should drive a meaningful improvement in return on equity relative to be approximately 20% expected for 2021.
In summary, we believe we are well positioned to achieve our targets for the both 2021 fourth quarter and 2022 fiscal year.
Our forecasted 2021 full year results represent significant improvements across virtually all our key metrics with notable increases in our scale, absorption pace, housing gross margin and operating margin.
In addition, we are particularly pleased with the forecast expansion in our full year return on equity and our anticipated further improvement in 2022.
We believe our ongoing focus on accelerating profitable growth and expanding our returns by leveraging our larger scale, attractive inventory profile and uniquely compelling built-to-order business model, will produce measurable enhancements in both book and stockholder value in future periods.

","Summarize call transcript. Focus on financial performance, strategic initiatives, and management's outlook.","
Our performance in the third quarter reflected significant year-over-year increases across the majority of our key metrics as we produced solid results in housing market, experiencing great demand, while also facing industrywide challenges in getting homes completed and delivered.
These results will help drive our returns focused growth as we continue to expand our scale, while generating a higher return on equity.
Before I get into the highlights for the quarter and there are many, I want to address our shortfall in deliveries and revenues.
Disruptions to our supply chain intensified as the quarter progressed and along with municipal delays resulted in our build times extending by about two weeks sequentially.
This pushed many deliveries into our fourth quarter and will similarly delayed some fourth quarter deliveries into our 2022 first quarter.
We are taking aggressive steps to manage through these delays, including expanding our subcontractor base, partnering with our national suppliers and simplifying our products to stabilize our build times.
We produced total revenues of $1.47 billion, up nearly 50% as compared to the prior year period and diluted earnings per share of $1.60.
We achieved an operating income margin of 12.1% excluding inventory related charges, which grew 250 basis points year-over-year, driving a 40% expansion in our profitability per unit to nearly 52,000.
This was accomplished even with the leverage we lost from the delayed deliveries.
Our related gross margin of 22% was a particular highlight and demonstrates that we are effectively managing pace, price and starts to optimize each asset.
As to capital allocation, we continue to take a balanced approach with disciplined investments in growth remaining our top priority.
In the third quarter, we invested about $780 million in land acquisition and development.
We expanded our lot position to almost 81,000 lots owned or controlled, with our inventory continuing to rotate into a higher quality portfolio of communities.
In addition to these investments, we returned a significant amount of cash to stockholders through both our regular quarterly cash dividend and the repurchase of $188 million of our stock.
These repurchases will further enhance our return on equity in 2022 beyond this year's expected 20% level, especially when combined with our projected increase in scale to over $7 billion in revenue and higher operating and gross margins.
Since we embarked on our returns focused growth strategy, we have produced meaningful expansion in our ROE.
While we recognized that returns across the industry have expanded, our rate of improvement is meaningful and we believe our return on equity in the low to mid 20% range is sustainable.
During the quarter, we announced the promotion of Rob McGibney to Executive Vice President and Co-Chief Operating Officer, a role he shares with Matt Mandino.
We created a Co-COO structure with two simple objectives in mind: to accelerate the profitable growth of our business in order to drive increasing returns on equity and to enhance our execution.
Rob is responsible for our West Coast and Southwest regions and Matt is responsible for our Central and Southeast regions.
In addition to their regional responsibilities, Matt and Rob each have oversight of key strategic corporate functions as well.
The operating environment within our industry has become more complex over the past 18 months, given the supply chain issues and municipal delays that I mentioned earlier and their impact on build times.
Having two proven leaders running our operations, will allow for a more hands on approach that is geographically focused, enabling greater day-to-day collaboration with our regional and division leadership.
We successfully opened over 40 new communities in the third quarter, marking the start of a sequential improvement in ending community count that we anticipate will continue over each of the next five quarters.
With the strong and growing lot pipeline that I referenced, driving an acceleration in new communities, we expect to expand our community count to roughly 260 by year-end 2022.
Our monthly absorption per community accelerated to 6.6 net orders during the third quarter from 5.9 in the year ago quarter and reflecting a more typical seasonal pattern sequentially, while remaining at historically elevated level.
Net orders were 4,085, represented a small decline year-over-year, against the strong results in the prior year quarter.
However, with our actions in taking price and moderating pace, our net order value was up more than 20% year-over-year.
We continue to manage our selling pace to production, limiting our lot releases to prevent our backlog from getting over extended and started over 4,000 homes during the quarter.
This compares to starts in the year-ago quarter of about 3,400.
We currently have approximately 9,000 homes in production with 93% of these homes already sold.
Only 240 of these homes are unsold past the foundation stage and our focus right now is on compression our build times to deliver our backlog.
With the rise in our net order value to $2 billion, we are laying the foundation for future margin growth.
Our pricing power is solid, while our pace remain strong and the dema"
3,"We have a great session planned for you today.
And as an organization, we're excited to provide you with a little extra detail about our business as typical for our September call.
Over the next 60 minutes or so, we will review our strong fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results, followed by yet another great outlook for fiscal 2022.
As usual, you will hear from both Mark Mondello, our CEO; as well as Mike Dastoor, our CFO.
Along this journey, we'll discuss our approach to the end markets we serve, the uniqueness of our supply chain solutions, and the innovation underway within our global network of factories.
And we'll kick that right off with the following brief video.
Such a great video.
As we all know, the world is complex and only getting more so each and every day.
But as Mark often says, our people are our greatest differentiator and that couldn't be more apparent as you visit our global network of factories and meet the roughly 260,000 people that make Jabil's foundation so strong.
Our foundation is solid.
Through over 50 million square feet of manufacturing space and 100-plus sites, our people strive to make anything possible and everything better for over 400 of the world's most recognizable brands.
Our agility and global scale enable us to respond quickly and flexibly to meet customer needs in key end markets, like mobility, industrial and semi cap, automotive, and healthcare, just to name a few.
These wide-ranging end markets represent a diverse and thoughtfully designed portfolio that, over the years, has helped reduce volatility and improve the reliability of our financial results.
To help illustrate our diversification strategy over the past few years, I'd now ask that you turn to the next slide, which shows our revenue growth and the end markets we serve.
As you may know, the EMS industry has long struggled with customer concentration, and this dynamic has created a lot of variability in operating performance from one year to the next.
In 2016, our management team concluded that our model was missing an important characteristic if we were going to deliver upon our financial priorities consistently and sustainably.
This important characteristic was product diversification.
So beginning roughly in the 2017 time frame, we embarked on a journey to grow and diversify our business in areas such as 5G, cloud, healthcare, packaging, connected devices, automotive, and semi-capital equipment.
As a result of our efforts to diversify the business, revenue has grown rapidly.
And since 2017, we have added more than $10 billion in revenue across several key end markets.
And it's important to note this growth has been very intentional and focused.
Moving to the right side of the chart, you'll see the composition of our $29.3 billion in revenue, and you'll likely notice that no end market dominates our diverse portfolio.
In each of these areas, Jabil partners with some of the world's most recognizable companies to accelerate their speed to market through product engineering, supply chain design and, of course, manufacture.
In healthcare, think of drug delivery systems, such as inhalers and insulin pens, diagnostics, medical devices, orthopedics, and instruments that all meet exacting FDA standards.
Our healthcare business serves programs and products with long stable life cycles of 10 to 20 years with high cost of change, thus providing stable earnings and cash flows.
In packaging, we design and manufacture highly engineered rigid plastic packaging for many leading consumer brands, bringing to bear capabilities in ideation, product design, material scientists, and eco-friendly barrier technologies.
Within mobility and connected devices, we generally focus on machining, tooling, and molding of highly engineered plastic and metal parts, leveraging a strong product development skillset.
In areas such as digital print and retail, we're focused on 3D print, large form factor printing, and retail automation.
And in industrial and semi cap, 5G wireless and cloud, and networking and storage, we participate in the design, product development, industrialization, and manufacturing of some of the most sophisticated tech products on the marketplace today.
And then in automotive, the bulk of our business focuses on the electrification of auto supported by a nearly 10-year relationship with the world's leading EV company.
So from mobility to retail automation to complex heavy industrial equipment, Jabil helps customers navigate large complex material supply chains while effectively managing change, mitigating risks, and delivering quickly and efficiently.
In summary, our business has grown rapidly over the last several years to serve a diverse blend of end markets that today are benefiting from long-term secular trends.
And again, this gives us the confidence and comfort to not only provide financial guidance more than one quarter out but also invest in things like factory innovation.
And when you drill down one level deeper, you'll again notice an incredibly diverse set of customers, representing some of the largest, most innovative, and successful organizations in the world today.
This by no means is a complete list of the customers we serve, but it's certainly impressive by any standard, especially when considering many of these customers rely on Jabil as the sole source for their products.
I'm sure most of you recognized some of our incredible partners such as Apple, HP, Ericsson, Amazon, Cisco, John Deere, Tesla, and J&J.
In all of our customer relationships, we're incredibly focused on delivering consistent value and reliable value from early in the product life cycle, like product innovation and design, to more mature products where we offer planning, automation, supply chain management and, of course, manufacturing.
At the end of the day, we build stuff at Jabil, and we do it really, really well.
This leads me to our financial priorities as a management team.
We're squarely focused on three areas: expanding operating margins, increasing earnings per share, and generating strong cash flows.
In fact, this focus has been further sharpened as we've embedded core margins, core earnings per share, and free cash flow within our short-term and long-term compensation programs as we believe this effectively aligns management and shareholders.
And over the next several minutes, we plan to provide you with a credible plan to improve all of these three metrics in fiscal '22.
Following me today will be Mike who joined Jabil in 2000 as a regional controller based in Hong Kong.
Mike will walk you through our fiscal '21 results and our robust financial plan for fiscal '22.
He will also spend some time highlighting our end markets and discussing some of the trends which should drive our business for many years to come.
Then Mark, who joined Jabil in 1992 as a manufacturing supervisor, will share some of the value that Jabil provides to its customers through our people, our culture, and our best-in-class manufacturing capabilities.
These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts, and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially.
An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020, and other filings.
As Adam highlighted, our business model is fundamentally structured to deliver core margin expansion and strong predictable cash flows, and our capital structure has been optimized to maximize our flexibility.
This flexibility has enabled us to reshape our end-market portfolio over the last several years, and in the last 18 months, our strategy has been pressure tested.
And our diversified, well-balanced portfolio performed extremely well evidenced by a solid Q4 and exceptionally strong FY '21 results.
In Q4, the teams in both segments successfully managed to navigate an incredibly dynamic supply chain environment.
During the quarter, demand continued to be broad-based and robust, but revenue came in slightly lower than expected due to some incremental tightness in the supply chain, mainly in healthcare, industrial, and cloud.
This was partly offset by upsides in connected devices and networking and storage.
Despite this, our core operating margin performance in the quarter was quite strong coming in at 4.2%, approximately 10 basis points higher than expected, a testament to our team's execution in the quarter, solid cost optimization, and our ever more resilient end-market portfolio.
In Q4, our interest and tax expense also came in better than expected, which when combined with the strong margin performance allowed us to deliver strong core diluted earnings per share in Q4, putting it all together on the next slide.
Net revenue for the fourth quarter was $7.4 billion, up 1% over the prior-year quarter.
GAAP operating income was $265 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.16.
Core operating income during the quarter was $314 million, an increase of 23% year over year, representing a core operating margin of 4.2%, a 70-basis-point improvement over the prior year.
Net interest expense in Q4 was $36 million, and core tax rate came in at approximately 22.3%.
Core diluted earnings per share was $1.44, a 47% improvement over the prior-year quarter.
Now turning to our fourth-quarter segment results on the next slide.
Revenue for our DMS segment was $3.9 billion, an increase of 9.7% on a year-over-year basis.
The strong year-over-year performance in our DMS segment was broad-based with strength across our healthcare, automotive and mobility businesses.
Core margin for the segment came in at 4.1%, 20 basis points higher than the previous year.
Revenue for our EMS segment came in at $3.5 billion, down 6.4%, primarily driven by our previously announced transition to a consignment model.
Core margin for the segment was 4.3%, up 120 basis points over the prior year reflecting solid execution by the team.
For the year, our DMS segment revenue was $15.4 billion, an increase of 17% over the prior year, while core operating income for the segment was up an impressive 49% year over year.
This resulted in core margins expanding 110 basis points to 4.8%, reflective of our improved mix.
In EMS for the year, core margins were also up strong, coming in at 3.7%, 100 basis points higher than the prior year on revenue of $13.9 billion.
Turning now to our cash flows and balance sheet.
Net capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $202 million and for the full fiscal year came in better than expected at $793 million or 2.7% of net revenue.
We sometimes hear from investors seeking clarification on our net capex, so I'd like to take a moment to walk you through the components.
As a reminder, our customers sometimes co-invest in plant, property, and equipment with us as part of our ongoing business model.
We often pay for these co-investments upfront, which are then subsequently reimbursed to us by customers.
The line item acquisition of property, plant, and equipment on our statement of cash flows includes the full upfront payment made by us.
The reimbursements by our customers are reflected as a sale of assets in the line item proceeds and advances from sale of property, plant, and equipment on our statement of cash flows.
The net of these two items reflects our true spend and what we refer to as net capital expenditures.
In Q4, inventory days came in higher than expected at 71 days, an increase of three days sequentially, driven by the previously mentioned incremental tightness in the supply chain.
While these higher inventory days may continue in the short term, we expect it to normalize below 60 over the mid- to longer term.
The management team continues to be fully focused on this metric, particularly in the current environment.
In spite of this, our fourth quarter cash flows from operations were very strong, coming in at $762 million.
As a result of the strong fourth-quarter performance and cash flow generation, adjusted free cash flow for the fiscal year came in higher than expected at approximately $640 million.
We exited the quarter with total debt to core EBITDA levels of approximately 1.4 times and cash balances of $1.6 billion.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.9 million shares, bringing total shares repurchased in FY '21 to 8.8 million shares or $477 million.
This brings our cumulative shares repurchased since FY '13 to approximately 90 million shares at an average price under $27, bringing our total returns to shareholders, including repurchases and dividends, to approximately $3 billion, reflective of our ongoing commitment to return capital to shareholders.
In summary, I'm extremely pleased with the resiliency of our portfolio and sustainable broad-based momentum underway across the business, which has allowed us to deliver exceptionally strong results in fiscal '21.
Next, I'd like to take a few moments to highlight Jabil's unique position across multiple end markets benefiting from long-term secular trends and the convergence of technology in our day-to-day lives.
We believe these trends will continue to drive sustainable growth and margins across the enterprise in FY '22 and beyond.
In healthcare today, on the next slide, the industry is undergoing tremendous change due to rising costs, aging populations, the demand for better healthcare in emerging markets, and the accelerated pace of change and innovation.
Consequently, we're witnessing healthcare companies shifting their core competencies away from manufacturing toward innovative and connected product solutions.
We continue to be in the early days of outsourcing of manufacturing in the healthcare space.
Our strategic collaboration, which we have highlighted in previous years, has enhanced our credibility within the industry and has further enabled Jabil to benefit from this outsourcing trend.
On top of this, we are also seeing the impact of connectivity, digitization, and personalized care across healthcare.
I expect these trends to accelerate over the next few years.
Our deep domain expertise within the healthcare industry uniquely positions us to build technology-enabled products which help our customers excel in today's evolution of healthcare.
Another end market experiencing a rapid shift in technologies is the automotive market.
Climate change, fuel efficiency, and emissions are ongoing concerns, and regulatory policies worldwide are beginning to mandate more eco-friendly technologies.
As a result, OEMs are making substantial investments into vehicle electrification efforts.
The bulk of our automotive business is focused on electrification of cars, which we believe still has plenty of room to grow.
Over the next three years, we expect the fastest-growing area of our auto business will be in what's known as ACE, autonomous, connectivity, and electrification.
Today, electric vehicles account for a small fraction of total vehicles in the market, but the EV segment overall is growing rapidly and gaining a larger share of the total vehicle market.
Jabil's long-standing capabilities and over 10 years of experience and credibility in this space have positioned us extremely well to benefit from this ongoing trend.
We are also extremely well-positioned to build the infrastructure that will power tomorrow, be it cloud, semi cap, 5G infrastructure, and the associated connected devices, or power generation and energy storage.
5G is expected to transform the way we live, work, play and educate.
As the underlying infrastructure continues to roll out, 5G adoption is accelerating.
Jabil is well-positioned to benefit from both, the worldwide infrastructure rollouts and with the devices, which will be needed to recognize the full potential of a robust 5G network.
5G is also accelerating secular expansion of cloud adoption and infrastructure growth.
This, coupled with the value proposition Jabil offers to cloud hyperscalers, is helping us gain market share in an expanding market, evidenced by the significant growth over the last three years.
In power generation and energy storage, we offer differentiated solutions across the entire energy value chain from energy generation, power conversion, transmission, storage, and metering to the management of power inside of homes and buildings.
In this space, we serve a diversified set of customers across numerous markets, including oil and gas, wind, power inverters and converters, smart meters, smart grid communications, building automation, home automation, and energy storage.
As the convergence of technology in our day-to-day lives accelerates, demand for semiconductors has increased exponentially, which has generated a huge backlog in this industry.
Jabil is well-positioned to help customers in the semi cap space with end-to-end solutions spanning the front end with design and complex fabrication equipment along with the back end with validation and test solutions.
So what do all these trends translate to in terms of Jabil?
You can see our revenue growth expectations by end market in the coming fiscal year.
In FY '22, in spite of supply chain headwinds, we expect incredibly strong growth in automotive and continued solid growth in healthcare and packaging, industrial, semi cap, 5G wireless, and cloud.
Today, both segments are in great shape.
We've repositioned our business to serve critical and long life cycle products while also providing the foundation for predictable, yet strong cash flows and margins.
For FY '22, we expect both gross profit margins and core operating margins to improve 30 basis points over the prior year, mainly driven by our end market growth and improved mix of business.
We also expect the investments to be made in areas such as IT, automation, and factory digitization will drive improved optimization across our footprint, which will translate to higher margins.
We expect these gains will be slightly offset by continued tightness in the supply chain, especially in the first half of our fiscal year.
However, we're incredibly confident in our team's ability to successfully execute in this market given our track record over the last several years.
Key to executing amid an incredibly dynamic environment is our expertise and the investments we made in our IT and supply chain.
We've got the tools and technologies that allow us to progressively manage with analytics and data some of the most complex supply chains in the world.
This has certainly been evident over the last two years.
Let's hear from our supply chain leaders and how they're executing for our customers.
Turning now to our capex guidance for FY '22.
Net capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $830 million or 2.6% of net revenue.
This will come through a combination of both maintenance and strategic investments for future growth.
Let's talk about our maintenance capex for a moment.
We now have 100 sites in more than 30 countries.
At this scale, our factories require approximately $500 million in annual maintenance investments.
Areas of investment are inclusive of IT and data analytics, automation, and factory digitization, which will drive innovation across our footprint.
This, along with upgrading of our equipment sets based on appropriate cost-benefit analysis, will improve first-pass yields and help reduce ongoing maintenance costs.
We are also investing in strategic growth in targeted areas of our business that are expected to deliver strong margin expansion and free cash flow.
The bulk of our strategic growth capex will be in the healthcare, automotive, 5G wireless, power generation and energy storage, semi cap, and eco-friendly packaging end markets.
All of this positions us well to deliver higher margins as highlighted earlier in my margin waterfall slide.
Our improved profitability, strong operational performance, and disciplined investments have yielded significant cash flows over the last few years, which has allowed the company to strategically invest in higher return areas of our business.
Moving forward, we expect to continue generating strong cash flows in spite of higher working capital associated with our robust growth in targeted areas I highlighted earlier.
This is possible as a result of earnings expansion, along with our team's disciplined approach and ability to execute.
In FY '22, we expect to generate adjusted free cash flow of $700 million.
As I mentioned earlier, we've intentionally targeted higher return areas.
In doing so, we're focused on end markets that offer higher profitability and good cash flow dynamics.
This discipline has translated to much higher returns on invested capital.
Moving forward, we will continue to prioritize investments in areas of our business with higher margins, which we expect will translate into strong returns.
Another key aspect of delivering higher returns and delivering long-term value to shareholders is ensuring our capital structure is appropriately balanced and optimized.
Over the last few years, our team has done an outstanding job of building a solid and flexible debt and liquidity profile with current maturities appropriately staggered and at very attractive interest rates.
We ended FY '21 with committed capacity under the global credit facilities of $3.8 billion.
With this available capacity, along with our year-end cash balance, Jabil ended the year with access to more than $5.3 billion of available liquidity, which we believe causes forges ample flexibility.
And importantly, we are fully committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit profile.
Turning now to our capital allocation framework.
In fiscal '22 and beyond, we expect to generate significant free cash flow.
Given this dynamic, I thought it would be appropriate to reiterate our capital allocation priorities and at a high level how we plan to deploy our capital over the next two years.
As a reminder, in July earlier this year, we announced a $1 billion buyback authorization from our Board of Directors over the next two years.
Our capital return framework beyond organic investments will continue to prioritize commitment to our dividend, share repurchases, and a combination of targeted M&A and capital structure optimization.
Moving forward, we are comfortable with our ability to generate strong cash flows and will remain balanced and thoughtful in how we allocate our capital.
Turning now to our first-quarter guidance on the next slide.
DMS segment revenue is expected to increase 10% on a year-over-year basis to $4.7 billion, while the EMS segment revenue is expected to be $3.6 billion, consistent with the prior year.
We expect total company revenue in the first quarter of fiscal '22 to be in the range of $8 billion to $8.6 billion.
Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $365 million to $425 million.
GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $321 million to $381 million.
Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.70 to $1.90.
GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.61.
The tax rate on core earnings in the first quarter is estimated to be approximately 25%.
As we transition to my final slide, you can really begin to see the earnings power of a diversified and balanced Jabil.
Today, our business serves a diverse blend of end markets in areas that provide confidence in future earnings and cash flows.
We have deep domain expertise complemented by investments we made in capabilities, all of which give us confidence in our ability to deliver 4.5% in core margins in FY '22 along with $6.35 in core earnings per share and $700 million in free cash flow.
And importantly, our balanced capital allocation framework approach is aligned and focused on driving long-term value creation to shareholders.
I appreciate everyone taking time to join our call today.
Your attitude is amazing and your stamina is incredible.
It was your collective body of work that drove the terrific results we just posted.
Results you delivered while overcoming COVID quarantine mandates, supply chain challenges, factory inefficiencies, and in many cases, a lack of face-to-face interaction.
Fiscal '21 came in well ahead of plan, resulting in a core operating margin of 4.2%.
All in all, a really nice year across all fronts.
Today marks our fourth annual investor session, a session where we take a little extra time to lay out the groundwork for the upcoming year.
As you heard earlier from Adam and Mike, our business is strong and what we're doing is working.
Much of our progress comes from the construct and the pedigree of our company.
So let's start with our approach, beginning with diversity, equity, and inclusion.
We know that each employee is critical to our success and has the right to be treated with dignity and respect each day and every day.
At Jabil, we operate our business in 30-plus countries.
We employ people that don't look the same, don't talk the same, people that practice different religions, have different sexual orientations, people with physical limitations and neurodiversities.
We understand that the current diversity of our team simply makes us better, but we have so much more work to do, and we're holding ourselves accountable through actions.
An example of the type of actions we're taking is the addition of our internal DE&I council, which was established in 2020, a nine-person council which guides us and advocates for the broader Jabil.
We also co-chaired an external DE&I certification program, a program attended by 165,000 participants, of which the vast majority earned their formal certificates.
And one other example is around the upcoming 2022 Special Olympics, where Jabil is a premium sponsor for the U.S. games.
And the best part of our partnership with Special Olympics is that it offers our employees the opportunity to spend time with the athletes and their coaches.
So in summary, our team continues to safeguard our work environment and does so with the acceptance of individual differences.
A second aspect of our approach pertains to the area of ESG, where we aim to always do what's right.
Much like our effort with DE&I, our behavior around ESG is grounded on actions.
An example of one of our actions is our greenhouse gas emissions, where our goal is a 25% reduction by 2025 and a 50% reduction by 2030.
Another set of actions that we have underway are directed toward our heightened focus on mental health, a topic that impacts most all of us, either directly or indirectly.
And one final action worth mentioning is our commitment to giving back.
Our employees will look to complete 1 million volunteer hours in aggregate during calendar 2022.
What a positive difference this will make throughout the communities where we work and we live.
As you might sense, DE&I and ESG are important elements of who we are, and they set the foundation for our approach.
Next, I'd like to talk about our solutions and how they're enabled by our structure, our investments, and our customers.
Our structure enables our collaboration, which allows us to move with precision and speed.
Our investments enable our execution which allows us to take the ordinary and apply the extraordinary.
And our customers enable our obsession, which allows us to solve the complex.
So not to be overly simplistic, but at the center of Jabil's core, we build stuff.
That's just what we do.
Therefore, we'll continue to be aggressive with our investments in the areas of factory automation, robotics, and machine learning.
And to help illustrate how we apply and leverage these investments, I'd now like to share a short video.
As we move to our next slide, you'll see a colorful pie chart which illustrates the current makeup of our commercial portfolio.
Today, our business is diversified and diversified at scale.
This provides Jabil a real competitive advantage when we consider the performance and balance of earnings.
I'd now like to go a degree deeper into the makeup of our business.
These eight sectors exhibit the diversified nature of our revenue, with each sector having a material contribution to our results.
We've been very diligent in pursuing the end markets we serve.
We've also spent significant time successfully positioning the company to capture possible tailwinds offered by various secular trends.
This portfolio is a wonderful mix of cash flows and margins.
And for sure, the composition of our business is a catalyst for our FY '22 outlook.
As we now look at our plan for fiscal '22, you can see the earnings power of the company.
We look to deliver a core operating margin of 4.5% on revenues of $31.5 billion, a 30 basis point expansion when compared to fiscal '21.
This translates to $6.35 in core earnings per share or 13% earnings growth year on year.
In wrapping up our fiscal '22 forecast, I'd like to note that our strategy is well understood across the company.
and what needs to be done is crystal clear.
If we take our FY '21 results and our FY '22 guidance and step back just a bit, this aperture suggests that what we're doing is in fact working.
This slide offers a fantastic backdrop to our ongoing story.
All in all, I feel good about where we've been, but I feel even better about where we're going.
Moving on from our financials.
I'd like to talk a bit about our purpose.
As a management team, we have a purpose that serves as our ultimate guidepost.
Our purpose enables our path and does so with an emphasis on caring, integrity, and proper intentions.
Speaking of our path, our path forward is formed by the beliefs shown on this slide.
For FY '22, we'll trust in these beliefs as we work to deliver to our commitments.
For me, we'll measure our success based on financial performance.
But we'll also measure our success based on keeping our people safe, customer care and improving in the areas of ESG and DE&I.
If our team accomplishes all of the above, it will be another year of humble achievement.
As we consider our outlook for fiscal '22 and the current trajectory of margins and cash flows, it's clear that our journey is nowhere near complete.
In closing, we've made tremendous progress as customers and shareholders remain at the forefront of our actions.
Most importantly, I want each of you to always be your true self without fear or anxiety, without harm or recourse.
I'm honored to serve such a trustworthy team.
As planned, we shared quite a bit over the past hour.
To summarize, we began by describing how Jabil has undergone deep and sustainable improvements to its business model.
And we highlighted the solid foundation upon which Jabil sits today.
Then Mike walked you through our financial results and outlook, which demonstrate the strength of our portfolio, which has been structured to navigate varying fluctuations in demand while also benefiting from long-term secular tailwinds.
And finally, Mark shared with you our unique approach, solutions, portfolio, and path forward.
These truly are exciting times at Jabil.

","From the earnings call transcript, summarize the key points. Focus on financial performance, strategic initiatives, and management's outlook.","
We have a great session planned for you today.
And as an organization, we're excited to provide you with a little extra detail about our business as typical for our September call.
Over the next 60 minutes or so, we will review our strong fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results, followed by yet another great outlook for fiscal 2022.
As usual, you will hear from both Mark Mondello, our CEO; as well as Mike Dastoor, our CFO.
Along this journey, we'll discuss our approach to the end markets we serve, the uniqueness of our supply chain solutions, and the innovation underway within our global network of factories.
And we'll kick that right off with the following brief video.
Such a great video.
As we all know, the world is complex and only getting more so each and every day.
But as Mark often says, our people are our greatest differentiator and that couldn't be more apparent as you visit our global network of factories and meet the roughly 260,000 people that make Jabil's foundation so strong.
Our foundation is solid.
Through over 50 million square feet of manufacturing space and 100-plus sites, our people strive to make anything possible and everything better for over 400 of the world's most recognizable brands.
Our agility and global scale enable us to respond quickly and flexibly to meet customer needs in key end markets, like mobility, industrial and semi cap, automotive, and healthcare, just to name a few.
These wide-ranging end markets represent a diverse and thoughtfully designed portfolio that, over the years, has helped reduce volatility and improve the reliability of our financial results.
To help illustrate our diversification strategy over the past few years, I'd now ask that you turn to the next slide, which shows our revenue growth and the end markets we serve.
As you may know, the EMS industry has long struggled with customer concentration, and this dynamic has created a lot of variability in operating performance from one year to the next.
In 2016, our management team concluded that our model was missing an important characteristic if we were going to deliver upon our financial priorities consistently and sustainably.
This important characteristic was product diversification.
So beginning roughly in the 2017 time frame, we embarked on a journey to grow and diversify our business in areas such as 5G, cloud, healthcare, packaging, connected devices, automotive, and semi-capital equipment.
As a result of our efforts to diversify the business, revenue has grown rapidly.
And since 2017, we have added more than $10 billion in revenue across several key end markets.
And it's important to note this growth has been very intentional and focused.
Moving to the right side of the chart, you'll see the composition of our $29.3 billion in revenue, and you'll likely notice that no end market dominates our diverse portfolio.
In each of these areas, Jabil partners with some of the world's most recognizable companies to accelerate their speed to market through product engineering, supply chain design and, of course, manufacture.
In healthcare, think of drug delivery systems, such as inhalers and insulin pens, diagnostics, medical devices, orthopedics, and instruments that all meet exacting FDA standards.
Our healthcare business serves programs and products with long stable life cycles of 10 to 20 years with high cost of change, thus providing stable earnings and cash flows.
In packaging, we design and manufacture highly engineered rigid plastic packaging for many leading consumer brands, bringing to bear capabilities in ideation, product design, material scientists, and eco-friendly barrier technologies.
Within mobility and connected devices, we generally focus on machining, tooling, and molding of highly engineered plastic and metal parts, leveraging a strong product development skillset.
In areas such as digital print and retail, we're focused on 3D print, large form factor printing, and retail automation.
And in industrial and semi cap, 5G wireless and cloud, and networking and storage, we participate in the design, product development, industrialization, and manufacturing of some of the most sophisticated tech products on the marketplace today.
And then in automotive, the bulk of our business focuses on the electrification of auto supported by a nearly 10-year relationship with the world's leading EV company.
So from mobility to retail automation to complex heavy industrial equipment, Jabil helps customers navigate large complex material supply chains while effectively managing change, mitigating risks, and delivering quickly and efficiently.
In summary, our business has grown rapidly over the last several years to serve a diverse blend of end markets that today are benefiting from long-term secular trends.
And again, this gives us the confidence and comfort to not only provide financial guidance more than one quarter out but also invest in things like factory innovation.
And when you drill down one level deeper, you'll again notice an incredibly diverse set of customers, representing some of the largest, most innovative, and successful organizations in the world today.

And again, this gives us the confidence and comfort to not only provide financial guidance more than one quarter out but also invest in things like factory innovation.
And when you drill down one level deeper, you'll again notice an incredibly diverse set of customers, representing some of the largest, most innovative, and successful organizations in the world today.
This by no means is a complete list of the customers we serve, but it's certainly impressive by any standard, especially when considering many of these customers rely on Jabil as the sole source for their products.
I'm sure most of you recognized some of our incredible partners such as Apple, HP, Ericsson, Amazon, Cisco, John Deere, Tesla, and J&J.
In all of our customer relationships, we're incredibly focused on delivering consistent value and reliable value from early in the product life cycle, like product innovation and design, to more mature products where we offer planning, automation, supply chain management and, of course, manufacturing.
At the end of the day, we build stuff at Jabil, and we do it really, really well.
This leads me to our financial priorities as a management team.
We're squarely focused on three areas: expanding operating margins, increasing earnings per share, and generating strong cash flows.
In fact, this focus has been further sharpened as we've embedded core margins, core earnings per share, and free cash flow within our short-term and long-term compensation programs as we believe this effectively aligns management and shareholders.
And over the next several minutes, we plan to provide you with a credible plan to improve all of these three metrics in fiscal '22.
Following me today will be Mike who joined Jabil in 2000 as a regional controller based in Hong Kong.
Mike will walk you through our fiscal '21 results and our robust financial plan for fiscal '22.
He will also spend some time highlighting our end markets and discussing some of the trends which should drive our business for many years to come.
Then Mark, who joined Jabil in 1992 as a manufacturing supervisor, will share some of the value that Jabil provides to its customers through our people, our culture, and our best-in-class manufacturing capabilities.
These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts, and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially.
An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020, and other filings.
As Adam highlighted, our business model is fundamentally structured to deliver core margin expansion and strong predictable cash flows, and our capital structure has been optimized to maximize our flexibility.
This flexibility has enabled us to reshape our end-market portfolio over the last several years, and in the last 18 months, our strategy has been pressure tested.
And our diversified, well-balanced portfolio performed extremely well evidenced by a solid Q4 and exceptionally strong FY '21 results.
In Q4, the teams in both segments successfully managed to navigate an incredibly dynamic supply chain environment.
During the quarter, demand continued to be broad-based and robust, but revenue came in slightly lower than expected due to some incremental tightness in the supply chain, mainly in healthcare, industrial, and cloud.
This was partly offset by upsides in connected devices and networking and storage.
Despite this, our core operating margin performance in the quarter was quite strong coming in at 4.2%, approximately 10 basis points higher than expected, a testament to our team's execution in the quarter, solid cost optimization, and our ever more resilient end-market portfolio.
In Q4, our interest and tax expense also came in better than expected, which when combined with the strong margin performance allowed us to deliver strong core diluted earnings per share in Q4, putting it all together on the next slide.
Net revenue for the fourth quarter was $7.4 billion, up 1% over the prior-year quarter.
GAAP operating income was $265 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.16.
Core operating income during the quarter was $314 million, an increase of 23% year over year, representing a core operating margin of 4.2%, a 70-basis-point improvement over the prior year.
Net interest expense in Q4 was $36 million, and core tax rate came in at approximately 22.3%.
Core diluted earnings per share was $1.44, a 47% improvement over the prior-year quarter.
Now turning to our fourth-quarter segment results on the next slide.
Revenue for our DMS segment was $3.9 billion, an increase of 9.7% on a year-over-year basis.
The strong year-over-year performance in our DMS segment was broad-based with strength across our healthcare, automotive and mobility businesses.
Core margin for the segment came in at 4.1%, 20 basis points higher than the previous year.
Revenue for our EMS segment came in at $3.5 billion, down 6.4%, primarily driven by our previously announced transition to a consignment model.
Core margin for the segment was 4.3%, up 120 basis points over the prior year reflecting solid execution by the team.
For the year, our DMS segment revenue was $15.4 billion, an increase of 17% over the prior year, while core operating income for the segment was up an impressive 49% year over year.
This resulted in core margins expanding 110 basis points to 4.8%, reflective of our improved mix.
In EMS for the year, core margins were also up strong, coming in at 3.7%, 100 basis points higher than the prior year on revenue of $13.9 billion.
Turning now to our cash flows and balance sheet.
Net capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $202 million and for the full fiscal year came in better than expected at $793 million or 2.7% of net revenue.
We sometimes hear from investors seeking clarification on our net capex, so I'd like to take a moment to walk you through the components.
As a reminder, our customers sometimes co-invest in plant, property, and equipment with us as part of our ongoing business model.
We often pay for these co-investments upfront, which are then subsequently reimbursed to us by customers.
The line item acquisition of property, plant, and equipment on our statement of cash flows includes the full upfront payment made by us.
The reimbursements by our customers are reflected as a sale of assets in the line item proceeds and advances from sale of property, plant, and equipment on our statement of cash flows.
The net of these two items reflects our true spend and what we refer to as net capital expenditures.
In Q4, inventory days came in higher than expected at 71 days, an increase of three days sequentially, driven by the previously mentioned incremental tightness in the supply chain.
While these higher inventory days may continue in the short term, we expect it to normalize below 60 over the mid- to longer term.
The management team continues to be fully focused on this metric, particularly in the current environment.
In spite of this, our fourth quarter cash flows from operations were very strong, coming in at $762 million.
As a result of the strong fourth-quarter performance and cash flow generation, adjusted free cash flow for the fiscal year came in higher than expected at approximately $640 million.
We exited the quarter with total debt to core EBITDA levels of approximately 1.4 times and cash balances of $1.6 billion.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.9 million shares, bringing total shares repurchased in FY '21 to 8.8 million shares or $477 million.
This brings our cumulative shares repurchased since FY '13 to approximately 90 million shares at an average price under $27, bringing our total returns to shareholders, including repurchases and dividends, to approximately $3 billion, reflective of our ongoing commitment to return capital to shareholders.
In summary, I'm extremely pleased with the resiliency of our portfolio and sustainable broad-based momentum underway across the business, which has allowed us to deliver exceptionally strong results in fiscal '21.
Next, I'd like to take a few moments to highlight Jabil's unique position across multiple end markets benefiting from long-term secular trends and the convergence of technology in our day-to-day lives.
We believe these trends will continue to drive sustainable growth and margins across the enterprise in FY '22 and beyond.
In healthcare today, on the next slide, the industry is undergoing tremendous change due to rising costs, aging populations, the demand for better healthcare in emerging markets, and the accelerated pace of change and innovation.
Consequently, we're witnessing healthcare companies shifting their core competencies away from manufacturing toward innovative and connected product solutions.
We continue to be in the early days of outsourcing of manufacturing in the healthcare space.
Our strategic collaboration, which we have highlighted in previous years, has enhanced our credibility within the industry and has further enabled Jabil to benefit from this outsourcing trend.
On top of this, we are also seeing the impact of connectivity, digitization, and personalized care across healthcare.
I expect these trends to accelerate over the next few years.
Our deep domain expertise within the healthcare industry uniquely positions us to build technology-enabled products which help our customers excel in today's evolution of healthcare.
Another end market experiencing a rapid shift in technologies is the automotive market.
Climate change, fuel efficiency, and emissions are ongoing concerns, and regulatory policies worldwide are beginning to mandate more eco-friendly technologies.
As a result, OEMs are making substantial investments into vehicle electrification efforts.
The bulk of our automotive business is focused on electrification of cars, which we believe still has plenty of room to grow.
Over the next three years, we expect the fastest-growing area of our auto business will be in what's known as ACE, autonomous, connectivity, and electrification.
Today, electric vehicles account for a small fraction of total vehicles in the market, but the EV segment overall is growing rapidly and gaining a larger share of the total vehicle market.
Jabil's long-standing capabilities and over 10 years of experience and credibility in this space have positioned us extremely well to benefit from this ongoing trend.
We are also extremely well-positioned to build the infrastructure that will power tomorrow, be it cloud, semi cap, 5G infrastructure, and the associated connected devices, or power generation and energy storage.
5G is expected to transform the way we live, work, play and educate.
As the underlying infrastructure continues to roll out, 5G adoption is accelerating.
Jabil is well-positioned to benefit from both, the worldwide infrastructure rollouts and with the devices, which will be needed to recognize the full potential of a robust 5G network.
5G is also accelerating secular expansion of cloud adoption and infrastructure growth.
This, coupled with the value proposition Jabil offers to cloud hyperscalers, is helping us gain market share in an expanding market, evidenced by the significant growth over the last three years.
In power generation and energy storage, we offer differentiated solutions across the entire energy value chain from energy generation, power conversion, transmission, storage, and metering to the management of power inside of homes and buildings.
In this space, we serve a diversified set of customers across numerous markets, including oil and gas, wind, power inverters and converters, smart meters, smart grid communications, building automation, home automation, and energy storage.
As the convergence of technology in our day-to-day lives accelerates, demand for semiconductors has increased exponentially, which has generated a huge backlog in this industry.
Jabil is well-positioned to help customers in the semi cap space with end-to-end solutions spanning the front end with design and complex fabrication equipment along with the back end with validation and test solutions.
So what do all these trends translate to in terms of Jabil?
You can see our revenue growth expectations by end market in the coming fiscal year.
In FY '22, in spite of supply chain headwinds, we expect incredibly strong growth in automotive and continued solid growth in healthcare and packaging, industrial, semi cap, 5G wireless, and cloud.
Today, both segments are in great shape.
We've repositioned our business to serve critical and long life cycle products while also providing the foundation for predictable, yet strong cash flows and margins.
For FY '22, we expect both gross profit margins and core operating margins to improve 30 basis points over the prior year, mainly driven by our end market growth and improved mix of business.
We also expect the investments to be made in areas such as IT, automation, and factory digitization will drive improved optimization across our footprint, which will translate to higher margins.
We expect these gains will be slightly offset by continued tightness in the supply chain, especially in the first half of our fiscal year.
However, we're incredibly confident in our team's ability to successfully execute in this market given our track record over the last several years.
Key to executing amid an incredibly dynamic environment is our expertise and the investments we made in our IT and supply chain.
We've got the tools and technologies that allow us to progressively manage with analytics and data some of the most complex supply chains in the world.
This has certainly been evident over the last two years.
Let's hear from our supply chain leaders and how they're executing for our customers.
Turning now to our capex guidance for FY '22.
Net capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $830 million or 2.6% of net revenue.
This will come through a combination of both maintenance and strategic investments for future growth.
Let's talk about our maintenance capex for a moment.
We now have 100 sites in more than 30 countries.
At this scale, our factories require approximately $500 million in annual maintenance investments.
Areas of investment are inclusive of IT and data analytics, automation, and factory digitization, which will drive innovation across our footprint.
This, along with upgrading of our equipment sets based on appropriate cost-benefit analysis, will improve first-pass yields and help reduce ongoing maintenance costs.
We are also investing in strategic growth in targeted areas of our business that are expected to deliver strong margin expansion and free cash flow.
The bulk of our strategic growth capex will be in the healthcare, automotive, 5G wireless, power generation and energy storage, semi cap, and eco-friendly packaging end markets.
All of this positions us well to deliver higher margins as highlighted earlier in my margin waterfall slide.
Our improved profitability, strong operational performance, and disciplined investments have yielded significant cash flows over the last few years, which has allowed the company to strategically invest in higher return areas of our business.
Moving forward, we expect to continue generating strong cash flows in spite of higher working capital associated with our robust growth in targeted areas I highlighted earlier.
This is possible as a result of earnings expansion, along with our team's disciplined approach and ability to execute.
In FY '22, we expect to generate adjusted free cash flow of $700 million.
As I mentioned earlier, we've intentionally targeted higher return areas.
In doing so, we're focused on end markets that offer higher profitability and good cash flow dynamics.
This discipline has translated to much higher returns on invested capital.
Moving forward, we will continue to prioritize investments in areas of our business with higher margins, which we expect will translate into strong returns.
Another key aspect of delivering higher returns and delivering long-term value to shareholders is ensuring our capital structure is appropriately balanced and optimized.
Over the last few years, our team has done an outstanding job of building a solid and flexible debt and liquidity profile with current maturities appropriately staggered and at very attractive interest rates.
We ended FY '21 with committed capacity under the global credit facilities of $3.8 billion.
With this available capacity, along with our year-end cash balance, Jabil ended the year with access to more than $5.3 billion of available liquidity, which we believe causes forges ample flexibility.
And importantly, we are fully committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit profile.
Turning now to our capital allocation framework.
In fiscal '22 and beyond, we expect to generate significant free cash flow.
Given this dynamic, I thought it would be appropriate to reiterate our capital allocation priorities and at a high level how we plan to deploy our capital over the next two years.
As a reminder, in July earlier this year, we announced a $1 billion buyback authorization from our Board of Directors over the next two years.
Our capital return framework beyond organic investments will continue to prioritize commitment to our dividend, share repurchases, and a combination of targeted M&A and capital structure optimization.
Moving forward, we are comfortable with our ability to generate strong cash flows and will remain balanced and thoughtful in how we allocate our capital.
Turning now to our first-quarter guidance on the next slide.
DMS segment revenue is expected to increase 10% on a year-over-year basis to $4.7 billion, while the EMS segment revenue is expected to be $3.6 billion, consistent with the prior year.
We expect total company revenue in the first quarter of fiscal '22 to be in the range of $8 billion to $8.6 billion.
Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $365 million to $425 million.
GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $321 million to $381 million.
Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.70 to $1.90.
GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.61.
The tax rate on core earnings in the first quarter is estimated to be approximately 25%.
As we transition to my final slide, you can really begin to see the earnings power of a diversified and balanced Jabil.
Today, our business serves a diverse blend of end markets in areas that provide confidence in future earnings and cash flows.
We have deep domain expertise complemented by investments we made in capabilities, all of which give us confidence in our ability to deliver 4.5% in core margins in FY '22 along with $6.35 in core earnings per share and $700 million in free cash flow.
And importantly, our balanced capital allocation framework approach is aligned and focused on driving long-term value creation to shareholders.
I appreciate everyone taking time to join our call today.
Your attitude is amazing and your stamina is incredible.
It was your collective body of work that drove the terrific results we just posted.
Results you delivered while overcoming COVID quarantine mandates, supply chain challenges, factory inefficiencies, and in many cases, a lack of face-to-face interaction.
Fiscal '21 came in well ahead of plan, resulting in a core operating margin of 4.2%.
All in all, a really nice year across all fronts.
Today marks our fourth annual investor session, a session where we take a little extra time to lay out the groundwork for the upcoming year.
As you heard earlier from Adam and Mike, our business is strong and what we're doing is working.
Much of our progress comes from the construct and the pedigree of our company.
So let's start with our approach, beginning with diversity, equity, and inclusion.
We know that each employee is critical to our success and has the right to be treated with dignity and respect each day and every day.
At Jabil, we operate our business in 30-plus countries.
We employ people that don't look the same, don't talk the same, people that practice different religions, have different sexual orientations, people with physical limitations and neurodiversities.
We understand that the current diversity of our team simply makes us better, but we have so much more work to do, and we're holding ourselves accountable through actions.
An example of the type of actions we're taking is the addition of our internal DE&I council, which was established in 2020, a nine-person council which guides us and advocates for the broader Jabil.
We also co-chaired an external DE&I certification program, a program attended by 165,000 participants, of which the vast majority earned their formal certificates.
And one other example is around the upcoming 2022 Special Olympics, where Jabil is a premium sponsor for the U.S. games.
And the best part of our partnership with Special Olympics is that it offers our employees the opportunity to spend time with the athletes and their coaches.
So in summary, our team continues to safeguard our work environment and does so with the acceptance of individual differences.
A second aspect of our approach pertains to the area of ESG, where we aim to always do what's right.
Much like our effort with DE&I, our behavior around ESG is grounded on actions.
An example of one of our actions is our greenhouse gas emissions, where our goal is a 25% reduction by 2025 and a 50% reduction by 2030.
Another set of actions that we have underway are directed toward our heightened focus on mental health, a topic that impacts most all of us, either directly or indirectly.
And one final action worth mentioning is our commitment to giving back.
Our employees will look to complete 1 million volunteer hours in aggregate during calendar 2022.
What a positive difference this will make throughout the communities where we work and we live.
As you might sense, DE&I and ESG are important elements of who we are, and they set the foundation for our approach.
Next, I'd like to talk about our solutions and how they're enabled by our structure, our investments, and our customers.
Our structure enables our collaboration, which allows us to move with precision and speed.
Our investments enable our execution which allows us to take the ordinary and apply the extraordinary.
And our customers enable our obsession, which allows us to solve the complex.
So not to be overly simplistic, but at the center of Jabil's core, we build stuff.
That's just what we do.
Therefore, we'll continue to be aggressive with our investments in the areas of factory automation, robotics, and machine learning.
And to help illustrate how we apply and leverage these investments, I'd now like to share a short video.
As we move to our next slide, you'll see a colorful pie chart which illustrates the current makeup of our commercial portfolio.
Today, our business is diversified and diversified at scale.
This provides Jabil a real competitive advantage when we consider the performance and balance of earnings.
I'd now like to go a degree deeper into the makeup of our business.
These eight sectors exhibit the diversified nature of our revenue, with each sector having a material contribution to our results.
We've been very diligent in pursuing the end markets we serve.
We've also spent significant time successfully positioning the company to capture possible tailwinds offered by various secular trends.
This portfolio is a wonderful mix of cash flows and margins.
And for sure, the composition of our business is a catalyst for our FY '22 outlook.
As we now look at our plan for fiscal '22, you can see the earnings power of the company.
We look to deliver a core operating margin of 4.5% on revenues of $31.5 billion, a 30 basis point expansion when compared to fiscal '21.
This translates to $6.35 in core earnings per share or 13% earnings growth year on year.
In wrapping up our fiscal '22 forecast, I'd like to note that our strategy is well understood across the company.
and what needs to be done is crystal clear.
If we take our FY '21 results and our FY '22 guidance and step back just a bit, this aperture suggests that what we're doing is in fact working.
This slide offers a fantastic backdrop to our ongoing story.
All in all, I feel good about where we've been, but I feel even better about where we're going.
Moving on from our financials.
I'd like to talk a bit about our purpose.
As a management team, we have a purpose that serves as our ultimate guidepost.
Our purpose enables our path and does so with an emphasis on caring, integrity, and proper intentions.
Speaking of our path, our path forward is formed by the beliefs shown on this slide.
For FY '22, we'll trust in these beliefs as we work to deliver to our commitments.
For me, we'll measure our success based on financial performance.
But we'll also measure our success based on keeping our people safe, customer care and improving in the areas of ESG and DE&I.
If our team accomplishes all of the above, it will be another year of humble achievement.
As we consider our outlook for fiscal '22 and the current trajectory of margins and cash flows, it's clear that our journey is nowhere near complete.
In closing, we've made tremendous progress as customers and shareholders remain at the forefront of our actions.
Most importantly, I want each of you to always be your true self without fear or anxiety, without harm or recourse.
I'm honored to serve such a trustworthy team.
As planned, we shared quite a bit over the past hour.
To summarize, we began by describing how Jabil has undergone deep and sustainable improvements to its business model.
And we highlighted the solid foundation upon which Jabil sits today.
Then Mike walked you through our financial results and outlook, which demonstrate the strength of our portfolio, which has been structured to navigate varying fluctuations in demand while also benefiting from long-term secular tailwinds.
And finally, Mark shared with you our unique approach, solutions, portfolio, and path forward.
These truly are exciting times at Jabil.

4,"Joining us today will be our Chief Executive Officer, Dennis Gilmore; and Mark Seaton, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
2020 was another strong year for First American.
Our revenues are running well above the prior year and then the pandemic hit impacting our business overnight.
Our top priority is to protect our people and serve our customers and we achieved both.
We quickly transitioned the majority of our employees to working from home and still closed over a million real estate transactions in 2020.
This accomplishment testifies to the dedication of our people and their commitment to our customers.
It also validates our many digital investments we have made to improve the customer experience.
I'd now like to shift my comments to the fourth quarter results.
We generated earnings per share of $2.49.
Excluding realized investment gains, earnings per share were $2.11.
Revenues in our Title Insurance segment were up 26% in the fourth quarter and we effectively managed our expenses, achieving a 53% success ratio, which contributed to a pre-tax margin of 18.9%.
Our focus on automating Title production and digitizing and closing process paid off in 2020.
In a year of rapidly surging volume we closed 32% more orders this quarter than the prior year, with just 6% more employees.
Our direct purchase revenue rose 32% in the fourth quarter.
We experienced an 18% increase in closed transactions and 11% increase in the average revenue per order.
This growth is a sign of a continued strength of the housing market.
Refinance revenue continued to benefit from low mortgage rates with revenue rising 79% over the prior year.
Commercial rebounded strongly in the fourth quarter.
Since the onset of the pandemic commercial has been slow to recover than residential.
Commercial revenue was down 39% in the second quarter, 29% in the third quarter and the fourth quarter improved to a 5% decline of an all-time high fourth quarter of 2019.
We are encouraged that the order momentum over the last few months has picked up and we expect to have a strong commercial year in 2020.
Turning to our Specialty Insurance segment, revenues were $141 million, a 7% increase over the prior year.
As we disclosed in January, our Property and Casualty business entered into a book transfer agreement, which provide qualifying agents and customers an opportunity to easily transfer their policies.
As of February 1, we are no longer quoting new policies and expect to discontinue policy renewals in May.
We anticipate the transfer will be complete by the end of the third quarter of 2022.
This transaction enables us to maintain focus on our core business and redeploy the capital to areas with higher expected returns.
In the fourth quarter, we raised our quarterly dividend from $0.44 to $0.46 and we repurchased 1.3% of our shares outstanding at an average price of $49.20 and have continued our buying in 2021.
We believe both the short-term and long-term prospects of First American are stronger than the market is giving us credit for and as a result of aggressively repurchased shares.
Turning to our outlook, early indications are that the real estate market will remain robust this year.
The strong open order pipeline we built in the fourth quarter is moving to the revenue at what is traditionally our slowest period.
In January, our purchase orders were up 17% and we opened 3,200 refinance transactions per day, continuing the same trend we experienced for the last several months.
And as previously mentioned, we think this will be another good year for our Commercial business.
While we are encouraged by the strength of our markets, we remain focused on the long-term opportunities of our business.
In 2021, we will continue to invest in automation of our title production process and in the refinement of our digital closing platform.
We plan to increase our technology spend in areas of product development, cloud migration, and security.
And we are building digital solutions across our company to transform the customer experience.
An example of this is Endpoint, our title and escrow company that was built from the ground up to deliver a reimagined closing experience.
We believe these investments will enable us to continue to generate strong earnings for the years to come.
In the fourth quarter, we earned $2.49 per diluted share.
This includes net realized investment gains totaling $56 million or $0.38 per diluted share.
Excluding these gains, we earned $2.11 per share.
In the Title Insurance and Services segment, direct premium and escrow fees were up 24% compared with last year.
This growth reflects the 32% increase in the number of closed orders, partially offset by a 6% decline in the average revenue per order.
The average revenue per order decreased to $2,500 due to a shift in the mix of direct title orders to lower premium refinance transactions.
However, at the product level, we continue to see higher average revenue per order for all order types.
The average revenue per order for purchase transactions increased 11%, refinance increased 3% and commercial increased 2%.
Agent premiums, which are recorded on approximately a one quarter lag relative to direct premiums, were up 25%.
The agent split was 79.1% of agent premiums.
Information and other revenues totaled $282 million, up 39% compared with last year.
A number of factors contributed to this growth including growth in mortgage originations that led to higher demand for the company's title information products and our acquisition of Docutech, which isn't included in the prior year results.
Investment income within Title Insurance and Services segment was $52 million, down 26% primarily due to the impact of the decline in short-term interest rates on the investment portfolio and cash balances, partially offset by higher interest income from the company's warehouse lending business.
This quarter, our investment income benefited from a $4.4 million catch-up related to our Warehouse Lending business On a go-forward basis, we expect investment income to be somewhere in the neighborhood of $45 million per quarter with short-term rates at current levels.
Personnel costs were $515 million, up 14% from the prior year.
This increase is primarily due to higher incentive compensation and salary expense and higher costs as a result of recent acquisitions.
Other operating expenses were $300 million, up 34% from last year.
The increase was primarily due to higher production-related costs as a result of the growth in order volume.
The provision for title policy losses and other claims was $81 million or 5% of the title premiums and escrow fees, an increase from a 4% loss provision rate in the prior year.
To recap, we raised our loss provision rate in the first quarter of 2020 from 4% to 5% due to the extreme economic uncertainty that existed.
Economic factors are a key variable in title claims experience.
And given the deterioration in some of those factors, we raised the loss provision rate.
But the housing market and general economy have improved since then.
By raising the loss provision rate 100 basis points, we have added $52 million of additional IBnR reserves in our balance sheet.
Yet our incurred claims in 2020 were $49 million below our internal expectations set at the beginning of 2020.
Paid title claims show a similar trend with claims $30 million below our expectation.
As always, we will monitor our claims experience and market conditions when evaluating our reserves and we'll evaluate it next in connection with our first quarter earnings report.
Depreciation and amortization expense was $37 million in the fourth quarter, up 24% compared with the same period last year, primarily due to higher amortization of intangibles related to recent acquisitions.
Pretax income for the Title Insurance and Services segment was$377 million in the fourth quarter compared with $284 million in the prior year.
Pretax margin was a record 18.9% compared with 17.8% last year.
Excluding the impact of net realized investment gains, pre-tax margin was 16.8%, equivalent to the prior year.
In the Specialty Insurance segment, pre-tax income totaled $27 million.
We recorded a benefit of $18.3 million related to a reversal of an impairment initially taken in the third quarter relating to our Property and Casualty business.
In the third quarter, this accrual was taken so the book value of our Property and Casualty business matched the expected proceeds from the sale.
We subsequently determined that a book transfer rather than a sale was a more attractive alternative.
This decision required us to reverse this accrual and our Property and Casualty business is currently carried at tangible book value.
The ultimate proceeds we'll earn in the book transfer will be immaterial.
Net expenses in the corporate segment were $22 million, up $4 million compared with last year, largely due to higher interest expense associated with our $450 million senior notes transaction which closed in May.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.4%, higher than our normalized rate of 23% to 24%.
The tax rate was adversely impacted by $7.4 million or $0.07 per diluted share due to a permanent tax difference related to the Property and Casualty business.
I'd like to provide an update on matters arising from our 2019 information security incident.
As previously disclosed, we received a Wells Notice from the SEC in September 2020.
We submitted our response in October and have had no substantive communications with the Commission since.
We continue to believe that the SEC matter, along with all other matters relating to the security incident, will be immaterial from a financial perspective.
Finally, turning to capital management, 2020 was an active year for our balance sheet.
We spent nearly $400 million on acquisitions, the largest of which being Docutech, which has been a great addition to our company.
We also returned significant capital to our shareholders.
We paid nearly $200 million in dividends and raised the dividend by 5% on two separate occasions during the year.
Pursuant to 10b5-1 plans, we also repurchased $139 million in stock at an average price of $43.44 in 2020.
We continued our repurchases under these plans early in 2021 deploying an additional $27 million at an average price of $52.97.
During 2020, we also invested $83 million in venture investments in the Property Tech Ecosystem, which gives us insight into high growth technology companies, many of whom have become strategic partners.
We believe our capital management activities have created value for shareholders and will continue to hunt for opportunities with attractive risk-adjusted returns.

Information and other revenues totaled $282 million, up 39% compared with last year.
A number of factors contributed to this growth including growth in mortgage originations that led to higher demand for the company's title information products and our acquisition of Docutech, which isn't included in the prior year results.
Investment income within Title Insurance and Services segment was $52 million, down 26% primarily due to the impact of the decline in short-term interest rates on the investment portfolio and cash balances, partially offset by higher interest income from the company's warehouse lending business.
This quarter, our investment income benefited from a $4.4 million catch-up related to our Warehouse Lending business On a go-forward basis, we expect investment income to be somewhere in the neighborhood of $45 million per quarter with short-term rates at current levels.
Personnel costs were $515 million, up 14% from the prior year.
This increase is primarily due to higher incentive compensation and salary expense and higher costs as a result of recent acquisitions.
Other operating expenses were $300 million, up 34% from last year.
The increase was primarily due to higher production-related costs as a result of the growth in order volume.
The provision for title policy losses and other claims was $81 million or 5% of the title premiums and escrow fees, an increase from a 4% loss provision rate in the prior year.
To recap, we raised our loss provision rate in the first quarter of 2020 from 4% to 5% due to the extreme economic uncertainty that existed.
Economic factors are a key variable in title claims experience.
And given the deterioration in some of those factors, we raised the loss provision rate.
But the housing market and general economy have improved since then.
By raising the loss provision rate 100 basis points, we have added $52 million of additional IBnR reserves in our balance sheet.
Yet our incurred claims in 2020 were $49 million below our internal expectations set at the beginning of 2020.
Paid title claims show a similar trend with claims $30 million below our expectation.
As always, we will monitor our claims experience and market conditions when evaluating our reserves and we'll evaluate it next in connection with our first quarter earnings report.
Depreciation and amortization expense was $37 million in the fourth quarter, up 24% compared with the same period last year, primarily due to higher amortization of intangibles related to recent acquisitions.
Pretax income for the Title Insurance and Services segment was$377 million in the fourth quarter compared with $284 million in the prior year.
Pretax margin was a record 18.9% compared with 17.8% last year.
Excluding the impact of net realized investment gains, pre-tax margin was 16.8%, equivalent to the prior year.
In the Specialty Insurance segment, pre-tax income totaled $27 million.
We recorded a benefit of $18.3 million related to a reversal of an impairment initially taken in the third quarter relating to our Property and Casualty business.
In the third quarter, this accrual was taken so the book value of our Property and Casualty business matched the expected proceeds from the sale.
We subsequently determined that a book transfer rather than a sale was a more attractive alternative.
This decision required us to reverse this accrual and our Property and Casualty business is currently carried at tangible book value.
The ultimate proceeds we'll earn in the book transfer will be immaterial.
Net expenses in the corporate segment were $22 million, up $4 million compared with last year, largely due to higher interest expense associated with our $450 million senior notes transaction which closed in May.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.4%, higher than our normalized rate of 23% to 24%.
The tax rate was adversely impacted by $7.4 million or $0.07 per diluted share due to a permanent tax difference related to the Property and Casualty business.
I'd like to provide an update on matters arising from our 2019 information security incident.
As previously disclosed, we received a Wells Notice from the SEC in September 2020.
We submitted our response in October and have had no substantive communications with the Commission since.
We continue to believe that the SEC matter, along with all other matters relating to the security incident, will be immaterial from a financial perspective.
Finally, turning to capital management, 2020 was an active year for our balance sheet.
We spent nearly $400 million on acquisitions, the largest of which being Docutech, which has been a great addition to our company.
We also returned significant capital to our shareholders.
We paid nearly $200 million in dividends and raised the dividend by 5% on two separate occasions during the year.
Pursuant to 10b5-1 plans, we also repurchased $139 million in stock at an average price of $43.44 in 2020.
We continued our repurchases under these plans early in 2021 deploying an additional $27 million at an average price of $52.97.
During 2020, we also invested $83 million in venture investments in the Property Tech Ecosystem, which gives us insight into high growth technology companies, many of whom have become strategic partners.
We believe our capital management activities have created value for shareholders and will continue to hunt for opportunities with attractive risk-adjusted returns.

5,"As always, we appreciate your interest.
Brent Wood, our CFO, is also participating on the call.
We refer to certain of these risk factors in our SEC filings.
We hope everyone and their families are well.
They continued performing at a high level amid a challenging unique work environment.
Our fourth quarter and full year results were strong and demonstrate the resiliency of our portfolio and of the industrial market.
Some of the results the team produced include Funds From Operation, came in above guidance up 8.7% compared to fourth quarter last year.
This marks 31 consecutive quarters of higher FFO per share as compared to the prior year quarter, truly a long-term trend.
And for the year, FFO rose 8% to a record $5.38.
This represents an $0.08 per share improvement over our original pre-COVID forecast.
Our quarterly occupancy averaged 96.9% and at quarter end, we were ahead of projections at 98% leased and 97.3% occupied.
Our occupancy is benefiting from a healthy market, with accelerating e-commerce and last mile delivery trends.
Also benefiting the occupancy was a high retention rate of 80% for the year.
Quarterly releasing spreads were strong at 15.4% GAAP, and 7.9% cash.
Our 2020 releasing spreads set an annual record at 21.7% GAAP and 12.3% cash.
This further marks six consecutive years of double-digit rent -- GAAP rent growth.
Finally, same-store NOI rose 2.2% for the quarter and 3.2% for the year.
In summary, during the prolonged, choppy environment, I'm proud of our team's results.
Today, we're responding to strengthen the market and demand for industrial product by both users and investors by focusing on value creation via development and value-add investments.
I'm grateful we ended the year at 98% leased, our highest quarter end on record.
Houston, our largest market at 97.2% leased, with a ten-month average rent collection of over 99%.
Further, Houston represents 13.1% of rents down 80 basis points from fourth quarter 2019 and is further projected to fall into the 12% as a percent of our NOI this year.
Companywide rent collections remain resilient.
For January thus far, we've collected approximately 99% of monthly rents.
There are still some unknowns about how fast and when the economy truly reopens and recovers.
Brent will speak to our budget assumptions, but I'm pleased that in spite of the uncertainty, we finished 2020 at $5.38 per share in FFO and forecast $5.68 for 2021.
As we've stated before, our development starts were pulled by market demand.
Thus, we halted starts for a few quarters last year, then [Indecipherable] again in fourth quarter.
Based on the market strength, we're seeing today, our forecast is for $205 million in development starts for 2021.
And to position us following the pandemic, we acquired several new sites during the fourth quarter with more on our pipeline along with value-added additions.
More details to follow as we close on each of these investments.
And to perhaps free [Phonetic] up the question, none of the development starts, value add investments or land purchases are in Houston.
Finally, our strategic dispositions during the quarter were to sell the last of our four buildings in Santa Barbara completing our market exit along with another Houston asset.
Brent will now review a variety of financial topics including our 2021 guidance.
Our fourth quarter results reflect the resiliency of our team and strong overall performance of our portfolio amid a very challenging year.
FFO per share for the fourth quarter exceeded our guidance range at $1.38 per share, and compared to fourth quarter 2019 of $1.27 represented an increase of 8.7%.
The outperformance continues to be driven by our operating portfolio performing better than anticipated, namely higher occupancy.
From a capital perspective, during the fourth quarter, we issued $17 million of equity at an average price just over $140 per share, and as previously disclosed, we closed on two senior unsecured private placement notes totaling $175 million with a weighted average interest rate of 2.65%.
That activity, combined with our already strong and conservative balance sheet has kept us in a position of financial strength and flexibility.
Our debt to total market capitalization is 19%, debt to EBITDA ratio is 5.2 times and our interest and fixed charge coverage ratio increased over 7.2 times.
Our rent collections have been equally strong.
We have collected 99.6% of our fourth quarter revenue and we have already collected half of the total rent deferred early in the year of $1.7 million.
Bad debt for the fourth quarter of $1.1 million included a single, straight-line rent charge of $677,000 as part of an ongoing process of replacing an existing tenant with a better credit tenant at a much higher rental rate at a California property.
Although the tenant was current on their cash rent, we were required to write off the remaining straight-line rent balance due to the probability of terminating their lease early to accommodate the new tenant.
As we have consistently stated, the depth and duration of the pandemic and its impact on the economy is indeterminable.
However, the degree of potential tenant financial stress and loss of occupancy we had budgeted throughout 2020 never materialized.
As a result, our actual FFO per share for the year of $5.38 exceeded our pre-pandemic guidance issued a year ago.
Looking forward, FFO guidance for the first quarter of 2021 is estimated to be in the range of $1.37 per share to $1.41 per share and $5.63 to $5.73 for the year.
The 2021 FFO per share midpoint represents a 5.6% increase over 2020.
The leasing assumptions that comprise 2021 guidance produced an average occupancy midpoint of 96.4% for the year and a cash [Phonetic] same property increase range of 3.5% to 4.5%.
Other notable assumptions for 2021 guidance include $65 million in acquisitions and $60 million in dispositions, $140 million in common stock issuances, $250 million of unsecured debt, which will be offset by $85 million in debt repayment and $1.8 million in bad debt, which represents a forecasted year-over-year bad debt decrease of 35%.
In summary, we were very pleased with our fourth quarter results.
We will continue to rely on our financial strength, the experience of our team, and the quality and location of our portfolio to carry our momentum into 2021.
Now, Marshall will make some final comments.
In closing, I'm proud of our 2020 results and excited to pursue our 2021 opportunities.
Our Company and our team are working well through the pandemic, as evidenced by a number of Company records set.
And as the economy stabilizes, it's the future that makes me most excited for EastGroup.
Our strategy has worked well in the past few years.
Coming out of this pandemic, we foresee an acceleration in a number of positive trends for our properties and within our markets.
Meanwhile, our bread and butter, traditional tenants remain and will continue needing last mile distribution space in fast growing sunbelt markets.
These, along with the mix of our team, our operating strategy and our markets has us optimistic about our future.
Leland recently passed away, and we will miss his eternal optimism.
And with that, we'll open up the floor for any questions.

6,"Sorry for that, we were having a few audio issues.
So we've redialed back in.
Joining me on the call today to discuss our quarterly results are CEO, Mick Farrell and CFO, Brett Sandercock.
Other members of management will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.
During our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures.
We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions.
However, our actual results may differ.
I'll then review top level financial results, some business highlights from the quarter, and a few key milestones.
Then I'll hand the call over to Brett, who will walk you through our financials in further detail.
Our team achieved another quarter of strong revenue growth across the portfolio driven by superb performance in the mask category particularly in the U.S. market with good performance across the 140 countries where we provide our solutions.
We continue to take market share with our software solutions that enable increased therapy adherence with resupply programs providing support to those who need it and with our innovative new products.
Customers are voting with their wallets and they are voting for ResMed.
As the world's leading software-driven medical device company, we are using digital health technology to transform the industry.
We have sold nearly 11 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices into the market and Air Solutions, our cloud-based ecosystem manages more than 12 million patients.
In the last 12 months, we have changed over 15 million lives by providing a person with a ResMed device or complete ResMed mask system to help them breathe better and live better lives.
In addition, our Brightree and MatrixCare software systems are helping to manage 19 [Phonetic] million more people outside the hospital.
Digital health technology is an integrator across everything that ResMed does.
AirView, myAir, Propeller and a portfolio of other digital health solutions allow us to better engage with our customers and partners, including patients, physicians, providers, payers and complete healthcare systems.
We are investing in advanced analytics and expanding our capabilities in machine learning and machine intelligence so that we can grow this digital health ecosystem at double digits on a volume basis.
We now have over 5.5 billion nights of respiratory medical data in the cloud and we are analyzing these data to derive actionable insights for the benefit of patients, physicians, providers and healthcare systems.
Our relentless focus on product and software innovation continues to set us apart from our competition.
We have massive opportunities ahead in sleep apnea, in COPD as well as in outside the hospital software to help patients live better quality lives, to help patients and healthcare systems save money and to help achieve better management of chronic disease.
We believe that the future of healthcare is outside the hospital.
That's where ResMed's competes today and that's where we are winning today.
We have the right elements in place to achieve our strategy and to drive financial success as we provide market leading value to customers.
Let's now briefly review our top level financial results.
We achieved another quarter of double digit revenue growth.
We were up 14% in constant currency across our portfolio.
This growth continues to be well balanced across our domestic U.S. as well as our global product sales as well as from our software as a service businesses.
We continue to deliver operating leverage with non-GAAP operating profit growth of 21% year-over-year and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.21.
I'd like to focus now on our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses.
In the devices category, we delivered a good quarter with year-over-year constant currency device growth of 8% globally supported by strong 9% device growth in the United States, Canada and Latin America geographies, as well as by improving, Europe, Asia and rest of world growth, which was at 6% constant currency in the device category.
We continue to face headwinds for device growth in France as a result of the 2018 and 2019 digital health-related fleet upgrades.
We expect that the headwinds will begin to abate in the upcoming European summer and we will start to return to market growth for devices in France during fiscal year 2021.
Underlying patient growth remains healthy around the globe and we continue to benefit from strong market dynamics with over 900 million people worldwide suffering from undiagnosed and untreated sleep apnea.
Growth in the masks and accessories category of our business was incredibly strong during the quarter.
We were up 16% constant currency globally in this category, well ahead of market growth rates, indicating that we gained significant market share with our latest patient interface innovations.
Removing the impact of some software within this category, we are still growing our global mask franchise in the mid teens.
Our flagship masks, the AirFit F20 and the AirFit N20 continue their growth across global markets.
The success of these masks was augmented by continued good uptake of our more recent masks launches.
We have launched a steady rhythm of mask innovation over the past 15 months.
We have just lapsed the successful launch of the F30 in the December quarter and we will lap the launch of the N30 the N30i and the P30i during the coming 12 months.
The F30i was launched just over a week ago combining the needs for patients in the freedom and the minimalist mask segments.
With our portfolio of solutions, we are ensuring that we have the right mask for every patient, every time.
We are innovating and expanding our mask portfolio to offer comprehensive options for physicians and home care providers and for the specific needs of the ultimate customer and that's the person who suffocates every night with sleep apnea.
We remain focused on driving innovation to meet underserved customer needs.
We are creating future products that are smaller, quieter, more comfortable, and more customized to each persons needs.
Through digital health technologies such as the myAir app, we are driving patient engagement with our therapy so that people can enjoy the benefits of better breathing and better sleep.
We have well over 2 million patients using myAir and leveraging its insights and personalized feedback through coaching algorithms.
In parallel, we are also ensuring that the cost of sleep apnea as a chronic disease can be better managed by physicians, providers, payers, and healthcare systems.
Our digital end-to-end solutions combined with available 100% cloud connectivity as well as information provided to patients on their own smartphones are all leading to significant improvements in cost, improvements in healthcare outcomes, and improvements in quality of life.
We believe cloud-based software combined with world-leading medical devices can add value and improve both clinical outcomes as well as the patient experience.
On the partnership front, our joint venture with Verily is creating software solutions to help identify and engage and enroll people with sleep apnea on a journey to better sleep and better breathing.
We have commenced pilots in a handful of U.S. cities to improve awareness, identification, and engagement with the importance of good sleep and breathing to overall health.
Our philosophy is this, the more a person knows about how much they suffocate every night and the consequences of that suffocation on their overall health outcomes, the more likely they will seek solutions.
At its simplest level, this partnership will drive incremental growth in our core sleep apnea business.
Over the longer-term and on a deeper level, this partnership will also allow ResMed to participate in a broad chronic disease management platform covering sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental health and beyond.
I'd like to now focus on our business in respiratory care.
There are nearly 400 million people suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD worldwide.
We don't believe these people are well served by global healthcare systems today and many COPD patients are frequent visitors to hospital emergency rooms with admissions and frequent readmissions.
We have a vision to better manage COPD patients through the use of technology with digital end-to-end solutions, technology such as our Propeller platform helps how patients are communicated to, it helps how they are encouraged in their medical care and it helps how folks are looked after as an individual person.
We believe that technology combined with world-leading medical equipment can add substantial value to improve both clinical outcomes and the patient experience.
We plan to offer a portfolio of solutions through all stages of COPD progression.
We will be there with stage 1 and stage 2 COPD patients as they commence inhaled pharmaceutical therapy managed by the Propeller platform.
We will be there with stage 2 and stage 3 COPD patients as they add portable oxygen therapy to their care.
We will also be there with stage 3 and stage 4 COPD patients as they commence non-invasive ventilation therapy and ultimately life support ventilation therapy.
We will manage the person on one end-to-end digital health COPD platform, helping the patients, helping their caregivers and loved ones as well as helping their physicians and providers so that they have the right information at the right time, lowering costs and improving outcomes.
Our team at Propeller continues to progress their business as we move along the path from pilot trials to commercial partnerships with both pharmaceutical partners and healthcare systems.
The digital health opportunity with inhaled respiratory medicine adherence will take time to build and we are making good progress.
In December, Propeller was included as the only chronic respiratory disease solution in Express Scripts' first formulary for digital health solutions.
In November, access for Propeller users was expanded to pharmacy services from CVS, from Walmart, from Kroger, and from Rite Aid.
This was accessed directly from the Propeller app via the My Pharmacy feature within that smartphone application.
We will update you on the milestones for Propeller with partners in both pharma as well as healthcare systems as we move forward throughout 2020.
Finally, I'd like to focus on our software as a service business.
We continue to integrate and optimize the out of hospital SaaS portfolio for long-term growth.
We are focused on leveraging our competitive advantage as the only strategic player competing with leading software solutions focused on home medical equipment providers, skilled nursing facilities as well as home health and hospice providers.
Our SaaS portfolio revenue grew 37% year-on-year this last quarter, benefiting from the MatrixCare acquisition that we lapped during November.
We estimate that the weighted average market growth rate of these sectors we compete in is in the high-single digits.
Excluding the timing benefit of the MatrixCare acquisition and on a pro forma basis, our SaaS portfolio grew in line with market in Q2.
Our plan is to beat that market growth rate over the medium to long-term.
As we reached the fourth anniversary of our Brightree acquisition here in 2020, we are achieving strong [Technical Issues] in our home medical equipment or HME sector with our Brightree team in Atlanta.
We just passed the one-year anniversary with our MatrixCare acquisition in the quarter and we are increasing our investments in our MatrixCare team up there in Minneapolis.
This investment is focused on new module introduction for our MatrixCare platform so that we can ensure that we are able to grow and share in our skilled nursing facility as well as home health and hospice sectors as we move forward.
We are doing the hard work to make MatrixCare as successful as Brightree is in the ResMed portfolio and we have all the elements in place to do that.
It took around 24 months to see strong sustainable returns from our investments in R&D and our management team at Brightree.
We think we can meet or beat that timeline for strong and sustainable returns from our MatrixCare investments that we are currently making.
Last quarter, we announced a collaboration with Cerner as their new preferred partner for home health and hospice software for Cerner's customers.
It is early days in that partnership and things are going very well.
We've started to migrate existing home health and hospice customers to our MatrixCare solution.
Our sales team is actively engaged with Cerner's sales team with customers learning of the benefits of our MatrixCare home health and hospice software.
We are excited to drive growth from this partnership.
The rich interoperability between our two solutions will provide value for both Cerner and ResMed customers as well as their patients and residents.
I would like to take a moment to announce an exciting technology tuck-in acquisition that we are just in process of completing.
Just this week, Brightree signed an agreement to acquire a company called SnapWorx.
SnapWorx is a privately held software company that provides patient contact management and workflow optimization for sleep apnea resupply.
The combination of Brightree's technology and live call services with this new SnapWorx technology creates the largest resupply base in the industry with end-to-end workflow automation.
For our HME customers, the combination of these two technologies Brightree and SnapWorx will increase patient adherence and increase operational efficiency.
We expect the transaction to close very shortly.
The acquisition of SnapWorx is expected to be neutral to our non-GAAP ResMed earnings per share initially.
However, we expect this acquisition will be accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share during fiscal year 2021.
In summary, we have the vision to transform and significantly improve software solutions across outside the hospital healthcare sectors.
We see a future [Technical Issues] of hospital care.
The continued success of our mask and device portfolio along with a solid pipeline of new products and new digital health solutions covering sleep apnea, COPD, and out of hospital software gives us confidence in continued growth as we move through the year.
We have positioned ResMed for the long-term as the global leader in digital health driving top line and bottom line growth as we execute toward our 2025 strategy.
We are focused on our triple aim.
First, to slow chronic disease progression; second, to reduce overall healthcare system costs; and third, to improve quality of life for the ultimate customer, the patient.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney for his remarks and then we'll go to Q&A.
In my remarks today, I'll provide an overview of our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020.
As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter.
Group revenue for the December quarter was $736 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter.
In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 14%.
Excluding revenue from acquisitions, group revenue increased by 11% on a constant currency basis.
Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our software as a service business, our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries were $408 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter.
Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $242 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter.
However, in constant currency terms, sales in combined Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 8% over the prior year quarter.
Breaking out revenue between product segments, U.S., Canada and Latin America, device sales were $204 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter.
Masks and other sales were $204 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year quarter.
Revenue in Europe, Asia and other markets device sales were $162 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, an increase of 6%.
Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets were $79 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, an increase of 11%.
Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 8% while masks and other sales increased by 16% over the prior year quarter.
Software as a service revenue for the second quarter was $87 million, an increase of 37% over the prior year quarter.
During the rest of my commentary today, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers.
The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles, purchase accounting fair value adjustment to MatrixCare deferred revenue, litigation settlement expenses, and acquisition-related expenses.
Note that this quarter for GAAP reporting purposes, we are now reflecting the portion of amortization of acquired intangibles attributable to develop technology in our cost of sales rather than being allocated to operating expenses.
We've made this change to align with SEC disclosure guidance.
This will mean we'll disclose both GAAP and non-GAAP gross profit measures going forward.
Going forward, I will reference this non-GAAP metric as I believe it is the best measure of our underlying gross margin.
Our non-GAAP gross margin improved to 59.7% in the December quarter compared to 59.1% in the same quarter of last year.
Compared to the prior year, our non-GAAP gross margin increased by 60 basis points.
This was predominantly attributable to favorable product mix and manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by typical declines in average selling prices.
Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the second quarter were $171 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter.
In constant currency terms.
SG&A expenses increased by 8%.
Excluding acquisitions, SG&A expenses increased by 2% on a constant currency basis.
SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 23.3% compared to 24.8% that we reported in the prior year quarter.
Looking forward, subject to currency movements and taking into account recent acquisitions, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 23% to 25% for the remaining two quarters of fiscal year 2020.
R&D expenses for the quarter were $50 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 18%.
Excluding acquisitions, R&D expenses increased by 4% on a constant currency basis.
R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.8% compared to 6.6% in the prior year.
Looking forward, subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for the balance of fiscal year 2020.
Total amortization of acquired intangibles was $20.6 million for the quarter, an increase of 30% over the prior year quarter reflecting the impact from our recent acquisitions.
Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $14.1 million.
Our non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $218.5 million, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $176.3 million, an increase of 22% over the prior year quarter.
On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 10.2% while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 11.6%.
Our tax rate was favorably impacted by a tax benefit of $20.3 million associated with the vesting of employee share-based compensation, in particular, the tax deduction associated with the vesting of executive performance stock units in November.
Excluding the impact from this benefit, our GAAP effective tax rate would have been 21.6% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate would have been 21.8% [Phonetic].
Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the second half of fiscal year 2020 will be in the range of 19% to 21%.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.21, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.10.
Now diluted earnings per share were also favorably impacted by the tax benefit that I've just discussed.
Excluding the impact of this gain, our non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $1.07.
Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $69.9 million reflecting robust underlying earnings, partially offset by the timing of tax payments with $111 million in tax paid in our second quarter.
Additionally, we made the payment for our settlement to the U.S. Department of Justice of $40.6 million this quarter.
Capital expenditure for the quarter was $25.1 million.
Depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totaled $45.5 million.
During the quarter, we paid dividends of $56.1 million.
We recorded equity losses of $6.9 million in our income statement in the December quarter associated with the Verily joint venture.
We expect to record approximately $6 million of equity losses each quarter for the balance of fiscal year 2020 associated with the joint venture operations.
Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share.
At December 31, we have $1.3 billion in gross debt and $1.1 billion in net debt.
Our total assets were $4.4 billion and our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels.
Finally, to recap, our top line revenue was strong this quarter with growth across all major categories.
Gross margin expanded and our operating costs remained well controlled.
As a result, we are continuing to drive operating leverage with Q2 non-GAAP operating profit up 21% year-on-year.
We are focused on driving operating results integrating our SaaS acquisitions and ensuring we continue to invest in our strategic long-term opportunities.
And with that, I'll hand the call back to Amy.
We will now turn to the Q&A portion of the call.
I would like to remind everyone to limit yourself to one question and if you have additional questions, please feel free to return to the call queue.
Christine, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.

We have massive opportunities ahead in sleep apnea, in COPD as well as in outside the hospital software to help patients live better quality lives, to help patients and healthcare systems save money and to help achieve better management of chronic disease.
We believe that the future of healthcare is outside the hospital.
That's where ResMed's competes today and that's where we are winning today.
We have the right elements in place to achieve our strategy and to drive financial success as we provide market leading value to customers.
Let's now briefly review our top level financial results.
We achieved another quarter of double digit revenue growth.
We were up 14% in constant currency across our portfolio.
This growth continues to be well balanced across our domestic U.S. as well as our global product sales as well as from our software as a service businesses.
We continue to deliver operating leverage with non-GAAP operating profit growth of 21% year-over-year and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.21.
I'd like to focus now on our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses.
In the devices category, we delivered a good quarter with year-over-year constant currency device growth of 8% globally supported by strong 9% device growth in the United States, Canada and Latin America geographies, as well as by improving, Europe, Asia and rest of world growth, which was at 6% constant currency in the device category.
We continue to face headwinds for device growth in France as a result of the 2018 and 2019 digital health-related fleet upgrades.
We expect that the headwinds will begin to abate in the upcoming European summer and we will start to return to market growth for devices in France during fiscal year 2021.
Underlying patient growth remains healthy around the globe and we continue to benefit from strong market dynamics with over 900 million people worldwide suffering from undiagnosed and untreated sleep apnea.
Growth in the masks and accessories category of our business was incredibly strong during the quarter.
We were up 16% constant currency globally in this category, well ahead of market growth rates, indicating that we gained significant market share with our latest patient interface innovations.
Removing the impact of some software within this category, we are still growing our global mask franchise in the mid teens.
Our flagship masks, the AirFit F20 and the AirFit N20 continue their growth across global markets.
The success of these masks was augmented by continued good uptake of our more recent masks launches.
We have launched a steady rhythm of mask innovation over the past 15 months.
We have just lapsed the successful launch of the F30 in the December quarter and we will lap the launch of the N30 the N30i and the P30i during the coming 12 months.
The F30i was launched just over a week ago combining the needs for patients in the freedom and the minimalist mask segments.
With our portfolio of solutions, we are ensuring that we have the right mask for every patient, every time.
We are innovating and expanding our mask portfolio to offer comprehensive options for physicians and home care providers and for the specific needs of the ultimate customer and that's the person who suffocates every night with sleep apnea.
We remain focused on driving innovation to meet underserved customer needs.
We are creating future products that are smaller, quieter, more comfortable, and more customized to each persons needs.
Through digital health technologies such as the myAir app, we are driving patient engagement with our therapy so that people can enjoy the benefits of better breathing and better sleep.
We have well over 2 million patients using myAir and leveraging its insights and personalized feedback through coaching algorithms.
In parallel, we are also ensuring that the cost of sleep apnea as a chronic disease can be better managed by physicians, providers, payers, and healthcare systems.
Our digital end-to-end solutions combined with available 100% cloud connectivity as well as information provided to patients on their own smartphones are all leading to significant improvements in cost, improvements in healthcare outcomes, and improvements in quality of life.
We believe cloud-based software combined with world-leading medical devices can add value and improve both clinical outcomes as well as the patient experience.
On the partnership front, our joint venture with Verily is creating software solutions to help identify and engage and enroll people with sleep apnea on a journey to better sleep and better breathing.
We have commenced pilots in a handful of U.S. cities to improve awareness, identification, and engagement with the importance of good sleep and breathing to overall health.
Our philosophy is this, the more a person knows about how much they suffocate every night and the consequences of that suffocation on their overall health outcomes, the more likely they will seek solutions.
At its simplest level, this partnership will drive incremental growth in our core sleep apnea business.
Over the longer-term and on a deeper level, this partnership will also allow ResMed to participate in a broad chronic disease management platform covering sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental health and beyond.
I'd like to now focus on our business in respiratory care.
There are nearly 400 million people suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD worldwide.
We don't believe these people are well served by global healthcare systems today and many COPD patients are frequent visitors to hospital emergency rooms with admissions and frequent readmissions.
We have a vision to better manage COPD patients through the use of technology with digital end-to-end solutions, technology such as our Propeller platform helps how patients are communicated to, it helps how they are encouraged in their medical care and it helps how folks are looked after as an individual person.
We believe that technology combined with world-leading medical equipment can add substantial value to improve both clinical outcomes and the patient experience.
We plan to offer a portfolio of solutions through all stages of COPD progression.
We will be there with stage 1 and stage 2 COPD patients as they commence inhaled pharmaceutical therapy managed by the Propeller platform.
We will be there with stage 2 and stage 3 COPD patients as they add portable oxygen therapy to their care.
We will also be there with stage 3 and stage 4 COPD patients as they commence non-invasive ventilation therapy and ultimately life support ventilation therapy.
We will manage the person on one end-to-end digital health COPD platform, helping the patients, helping their caregivers and loved ones as well as helping their physicians and providers so that they have the right information at the right time, lowering costs and improving outcomes.
Our team at Propeller continues to progress their business as we move along the path from pilot trials to commercial partnerships with both pharmaceutical partners and healthcare systems.
The digital health opportunity with inhaled respiratory medicine adherence will take time to build and we are making good progress.
In December, Propeller was included as the only chronic respiratory disease solution in Express Scripts' first formulary for digital health solutions.
In November, access for Propeller users was expanded to pharmacy services from CVS, from Walmart, from Kroger, and from Rite Aid.
This was accessed directly from the Propeller app via the My Pharmacy feature within that smartphone application.
We will update you on the milestones for Propeller with partners in both pharma as well as healthcare systems as we move forward throughout 2020.
Finally, I'd like to focus on our software as a service business.
We continue to integrate and optimize the out of hospital SaaS portfolio for long-term growth.
We are focused on leveraging our competitive advantage as the only strategic player competing with leading software solutions focused on home medical equipment providers, skilled nursing facilities as well as home health and hospice providers.
Our SaaS portfolio revenue grew 37% year-on-year this last quarter, benefiting from the MatrixCare acquisition that we lapped during November.
We estimate that the weighted average market growth rate of these sectors we compete in is in the high-single digits.
Excluding the timing benefit of the MatrixCare acquisition and on a pro forma basis, our SaaS portfolio grew in line with market in Q2.
Our plan is to beat that market growth rate over the medium to long-term.
As we reached the fourth anniversary of our Brightree acquisition here in 2020, we are achieving strong [Technical Issues] in our home medical equipment or HME sector with our Brightree team in Atlanta.
We just passed the one-year anniversary with our MatrixCare acquisition in the quarter and we are increasing our investments in our MatrixCare team up there in Minneapolis.
This investment is focused on new module introduction for our MatrixCare platform so that we can ensure that we are able to grow and share in our skilled nursing facility as well as home health and hospice sectors as we move forward.
We are doing the hard work to make MatrixCare as successful as Brightree is in the ResMed portfolio and we have all the elements in place to do that.
It took around 24 months to see strong sustainable returns from our investments in R&D and our management team at Brightree.
We think we can meet or beat that timeline for strong and sustainable returns from our MatrixCare investments that we are currently making.
Last quarter, we announced a collaboration with Cerner as their new preferred partner for home health and hospice software for Cerner's customers.
It is early days in that partnership and things are going very well.
We've started to migrate existing home health and hospice customers to our MatrixCare solution.
Our sales team is actively engaged with Cerner's sales team with customers learning of the benefits of our MatrixCare home health and hospice software.
We are excited to drive growth from this partnership.
The rich interoperability between our two solutions will provide value for both Cerner and ResMed customers as well as their patients and residents.
I would like to take a moment to announce an exciting technology tuck-in acquisition that we are just in process of completing.
Just this week, Brightree signed an agreement to acquire a company called SnapWorx.
SnapWorx is a privately held software company that provides patient contact management and workflow optimization for sleep apnea resupply.
The combination of Brightree's technology and live call services with this new SnapWorx technology creates the largest resupply base in the industry with end-to-end workflow automation.
For our HME customers, the combination of these two technologies Brightree and SnapWorx will increase patient adherence and increase operational efficiency.
We expect the transaction to close very shortly.
The acquisition of SnapWorx is expected to be neutral to our non-GAAP ResMed earnings per share initially.
However, we expect this acquisition will be accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share during fiscal year 2021.
In summary, we have the vision to transform and significantly improve software solutions across outside the hospital healthcare sectors.
We see a future [Technical Issues] of hospital care.
The continued success of our mask and device portfolio along with a solid pipeline of new products and new digital health solutions covering sleep apnea, COPD, and out of hospital software gives us confidence in continued growth as we move through the year.
We have positioned ResMed for the long-term as the global leader in digital health driving top line and bottom line growth as we execute toward our 2025 strategy.
We are focused on our triple aim.
First, to slow chronic disease progression; second, to reduce overall healthcare system costs; and third, to improve quality of life for the ultimate customer, the patient.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney for his remarks and then we'll go to Q&A.
In my remarks today, I'll provide an overview of our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020.
As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter.
Group revenue for the December quarter was $736 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter.
In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 14%.
Excluding revenue from acquisitions, group revenue increased by 11% on a constant currency basis.
Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our software as a service business, our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries were $408 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter.
Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $242 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter.
However, in constant currency terms, sales in combined Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 8% over the prior year quarter.
Breaking out revenue between product segments, U.S., Canada and Latin America, device sales were $204 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter.
Masks and other sales were $204 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year quarter.
Revenue in Europe, Asia and other markets device sales were $162 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, an increase of 6%.
Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets were $79 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, an increase of 11%.
Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 8% while masks and other sales increased by 16% over the prior year quarter.
Software as a service revenue for the second quarter was $87 million, an increase of 37% over the prior year quarter.
During the rest of my commentary today, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers.
The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles, purchase accounting fair value adjustment to MatrixCare deferred revenue, litigation settlement expenses, and acquisition-related expenses.
Note that this quarter for GAAP reporting purposes, we are now reflecting the portion of amortization of acquired intangibles attributable to develop technology in our cost of sales rather than being allocated to operating expenses.
We've made this change to align with SEC disclosure guidance.
This will mean we'll disclose both GAAP and non-GAAP gross profit measures going forward.
Going forward, I will reference this non-GAAP metric as I believe it is the best measure of our underlying gross margin.
Our non-GAAP gross margin improved to 59.7% in the December quarter compared to 59.1% in the same quarter of last year.
Compared to the prior year, our non-GAAP gross margin increased by 60 basis points.
This was predominantly attributable to favorable product mix and manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by typical declines in average selling prices.
Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the second quarter were $171 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter.
In constant currency terms.
SG&A expenses increased by 8%.
Excluding acquisitions, SG&A expenses increased by 2% on a constant currency basis.
SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 23.3% compared to 24.8% that we reported in the prior year quarter.
Looking forward, subject to currency movements and taking into account recent acquisitions, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 23% to 25% for the remaining two quarters of fiscal year 2020.
R&D expenses for the quarter were $50 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 18%.
Excluding acquisitions, R&D expenses increased by 4% on a constant currency basis.
R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.8% compared to 6.6% in the prior year.
Looking forward, subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for the balance of fiscal year 2020.
Total amortization of acquired intangibles was $20.6 million for the quarter, an increase of 30% over the prior year quarter reflecting the impact from our recent acquisitions.
Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $14.1 million.
Our non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $218.5 million, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $176.3 million, an increase of 22% over the prior year quarter.
On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 10.2% while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 11.6%.
Our tax rate was favorably impacted by a tax benefit of $20.3 million associated with the vesting of employee share-based compensation, in particular, the tax deduction associated with the vesting of executive performance stock units in November.
Excluding the impact from this benefit, our GAAP effective tax rate would have been 21.6% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate would have been 21.8% [Phonetic].
Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the second half of fiscal year 2020 will be in the range of 19% to 21%.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.21, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.10.
Now diluted earnings per share were also favorably impacted by the tax benefit that I've just discussed.
Excluding the impact of this gain, our non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $1.07.
Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $69.9 million reflecting robust underlying earnings, partially offset by the timing of tax payments with $111 million in tax paid in our second quarter.
Additionally, we made the payment for our settlement to the U.S. Department of Justice of $40.6 million this quarter.
Capital expenditure for the quarter was $25.1 million.
Depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totaled $45.5 million.
During the quarter, we paid dividends of $56.1 million.
We recorded equity losses of $6.9 million in our income statement in the December quarter associated with the Verily joint venture.
We expect to record approximately $6 million of equity losses each quarter for the balance of fiscal year 2020 associated with the joint venture operations.
Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share.
At December 31, we have $1.3 billion in gross debt and $1.1 billion in net debt.
Our total assets were $4.4 billion and our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels.
Finally, to recap, our top line revenue was strong this quarter with growth across all major categories.
Gross margin expanded and our operating costs remained well controlled.
As a result, we are continuing to drive operating leverage with Q2 non-GAAP operating profit up 21% year-on-year.
We are focused on driving operating results integrating our SaaS acquisitions and ensuring we continue to invest in our strategic long-term opportunities.
And with that, I'll hand the call back to Amy.
We will now turn to the Q&A portion of the call.
I would like to remind everyone to limit yourself to one question and if you have additional questions, please feel free to return to the call queue.
Christine, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.

ResMed reports second-quarter results.
"
7,"On our call today, we have Andy Rose, Worthington's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Hayek, Worthington's Chief Financial Officer.
We had another strong quarter in Q2 with reported earnings of $2.15 per share compared to a loss of $1.40 in Q2 a year ago.
Excluding a small onetime restructuring gain, we generated a second quarter record $2.12 per share in Q2.
In the prior year period, excluding restructuring and the unrealized loss and onetime charges associated with our investment in Nikola, we generated earnings of $0.95 per share.
Consolidated net sales in the quarter of $1.2 billion were up significantly compared to $731 million in Q2 of last year.
Increase in sales was primarily due to higher steel prices along with increased volumes across our businesses and our recent acquisitions.
Our gross profit for the quarter increased to $185 million from $135 million in the prior year quarter and gross margin was 15% versus 18.5%.
Our adjusted EBITDA in Q2 was $168 million, up from $96 million in Q2 of last year and our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA is now $677 million.
I'll now spend a few minutes on each of the businesses.
In Steel Processing, net sales of $938 million doubled from $469 million in Q2 of last year, primarily due to higher average selling prices and a slight increase in volumes.
Total shipped tons were up 4% from last year's second quarter through the inclusion of Shiloh's BlankLight business and were flat excluding that acquisition.
Direct tons in Q2 were 47% of the mix compared to 48% in the prior year quarter.
Automotive demand is still difficult to predict, but late in the quarter, production forecast began to improve, and we're optimistic that trend will continue.
Production levels in automotive are not approaching historic averages, and a myriad of risks and challenges will persist for several quarters, but we are seeing indications that the worst of the semiconductor-related production interruptions may have passed.
Demand across our other major end markets remains robust.
And while supply chains and steel availability remains tight, our teams continue to navigate those challenges exceptionally well.
In Q2, steel generated adjusted EBIT of $72 million compared to $34 million last year.
The large YoverY increase was primarily driven by higher spreads combined with slightly higher volumes.
In the quarter, the scrap gap remained wider than historic averages.
In Q2, we had pre-tax inventory holding gains estimated to be $42 million or $0.61 per share compared to negligible gains in Q2 of last year.
Based on recent declines in steel prices, we believe we will have meaningful inventory holding losses in Q3 and will also face continued headwinds from the scrap gap.
In Consumer Products, net sales in Q2 were $141 million, up 20% from $118 million in the prior year quarter.
The increase was driven by the inclusion of sales from GTI, which we acquired in January, combined with higher average selling prices.
Adjusted EBIT for the consumer business was $18 million, and adjusted EBIT margin was 13% during Q2 compared to $17 million and 15% in the prior year quarter.
Consumer team continues to do an excellent job managing through a fluid environment.
Demand remains robust, and we have invested in new equipment and headcount to increase our production capacity.
Margins have been under some pressure due to higher input costs and we're limited in our ability to pass those costs along because of fixed price contracts with customers.
Late in Q2, we were able to start recapturing some of that margin.
And as a result, we expect margins will improve moving forward.
Building Products generated net sales of $121 million in Q2, which was up 29% from $94 million in the prior year quarter.
The increase was primarily due to higher volumes as construction markets continue to grow and higher average selling prices.
Building Products adjusted EBIT was $55 million, and adjusted EBIT margin was 45%, up significantly from $26 million and 28% in Q2 of last year.
The large year-over-year increase was driven by record results at ClarkDietrich, contributed $27 million in equity earnings, combined with solid results from WAVE who contributed $22 million.
Those teams have done a great job continuing to deliver value for their customers in a rising price environment.
Our wholly owned Building Products business generated 47% year-over-year EBIT growth in the quarter due to an improved demand environment and higher average selling prices.
The markets for our products and solutions, which are driven by commercial and residential construction, continue to show strength as the economy recovers, and we are maintaining and growing our share through new product development and our ability to add value to our customers' efforts.
In Sustainable Energy Solutions, net sales in Q2 were $33 million, down slightly from $34 million in the prior year.
Despite continued demand headwinds related to semiconductor chip shortages at their customers, the business was profitable and reported adjusted EBIT of $1 million in the current period compared to $2 million in the prior year.
This business is in the early stages of repositioning itself to serve the global hydrogen ecosystem and adjacent sustainable energies like compressed natural gas.
We're very pleased with our progress and some early wins.
The markets we serve will take time to develop, but we're very excited about our growth prospects over the long term.
With respect to cash flows and our balance sheet, operations used cash of $119 million in the quarter driven by a $235 million increase in operating working capital, primarily associated with higher steel prices.
For context, we've added $568 million in working capital over the last 12 months, and our free cash flow in that same period is an outflow of $201 million.
As steel prices decline, these increases in working capital should subside, and ultimately reverse, as they are converted back into cash.
During the quarter, we received $29 million in dividends from our unconsolidated JVs, invested $24 million in capital projects, paid $15 million in dividends and spent $13 million to repurchase 235,000 shares of our common stock.
Following our Q2 purchases, we have slightly over 8 million shares remaining under our repurchase authorization.
Looking at our balance sheet and liquidity position.
Funded debt at quarter end of $702 million and interest expense of $7 million were both down slightly compared to the prior year, primarily due to favorable exchange rates for our euro-denominated debt.
We ended Q2 with $225 million in cash which we used to fund our December 1 acquisition of Tempel Steel.
Earlier today, the Board declared a $0.28 per share dividend for the quarter, which is payable in March of 2022.
I'm proud of our employees for delivering yet another record quarter, the best second quarter in the company's history and the third best quarter ever.
It's a great way to finish the calendar year and enter the holiday season.
We have a lot of positive momentum in our businesses, but operating challenges remain, some of which we have been able to improve over the past few months.
Supply chain issues still exist, but the chip shortage appears to be improving, although it is still impacting our automotive volumes.
Our HR team has done excellent work reducing the number of open positions across the company but labor availability is tight and not expected to change much in the foreseeable future.
Our success is directly attributable to the efforts of our people who continue to do exceptional work meeting customer needs.
Demand levels are good across almost all of our end markets, and backlogs are solid.
In Consumer Products, price increases needed to offset rising costs are beginning to show up in our financial results and will help profitability going forward.
We continued to invest in working capital during the quarter and have added almost $600 million in the past year, but the price of hot-rolled steel peaked during the quarter in the mid-1,900s [Phonetic] and has already fallen close to $300 a ton.
Our purchasing team believes there are more declines coming, although the pace of that decline remains open for debate.
Consumer Products, Building Products and Sustainable Energy Solutions all performed well during the quarter, but a special mention to the team at ClarkDietrich, who have successfully navigated the challenging environment to record profits.
We continue to be very bullish on the future of all of these business segments as we refine and execute broader and more aggressive growth strategies.
Leveraging innovation, transformation and M&A will drive above-market growth and higher returns on capital.
We also completed our Investor Day in November.
We are thrilled to have closed the acquisition of Tempel Steel on December 1.
Tempel is already a global leader in the electrical steel laminations market, which supplies the manufacturers of transformers, electric motors and electric vehicle motors.
This business is led by a talented team and should experience significant growth in the coming years as the world converts to electric vehicles and the electricity infrastructure is upgraded and expanded to meet these demands.
The business environment continues to be very dynamic, whether it's COVID, labor shortages, supply chain issues or the volatility in commodities, particularly steel.
Our teams continue to excel in managing through these challenges safely and effectively.
Our customers' needs are being met, and our shareholders are being rewarded with record profits.
We'll now take questions.

We had another strong quarter in Q2 with reported earnings of $2.15 per share compared to a loss of $1.40 in Q2 a year ago.
Excluding a small onetime restructuring gain, we generated a second quarter record $2.12 per share in Q2.
In the prior year period, excluding restructuring and the unrealized loss and onetime charges associated with our investment in Nikola, we generated earnings of $0.95 per share.
Consolidated net sales in the quarter of $1.2 billion were up significantly compared to $731 million in Q2 of last year.
Increase in sales was primarily due to higher steel prices along with increased volumes across our businesses and our recent acquisitions.
Our gross profit for the quarter increased to $185 million from $135 million in the prior year quarter and gross margin was 15% versus 18.5%.
Our adjusted EBITDA in Q2 was $168 million, up from $96 million in Q2 of last year and our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA is now $677 million.
I'll now spend a few minutes on each of the businesses.
In Steel Processing, net sales of $938 million doubled from $469 million in Q2 of last year, primarily due to higher average selling prices and a slight increase in volumes.
Total shipped tons were up 4% from last year's second quarter through the inclusion of Shiloh's BlankLight business and were flat excluding that acquisition.
Direct tons in Q2 were 47% of the mix compared to 48% in the prior year quarter.
Automotive demand is still difficult to predict, but late in the quarter, production forecast began to improve, and we're optimistic that trend will continue.
Production levels in automotive are not approaching historic averages, and a myriad of risks and challenges will persist for several quarters, but we are seeing indications that the worst of the semiconductor-related production interruptions may have passed.
Demand across our other major end markets remains robust.
And while supply chains and steel availability remains tight, our teams continue to navigate those challenges exceptionally well.
In Q2, steel generated adjusted EBIT of $72 million compared to $34 million last year.
The large YoverY increase was primarily driven by higher spreads combined with slightly higher volumes.
In the quarter, the scrap gap remained wider than historic averages.
In Q2, we had pre-tax inventory holding gains estimated to be $42 million or $0.61 per share compared to negligible gains in Q2 of last year.
Based on recent declines in steel prices, we believe we will have meaningful inventory holding losses in Q3 and will also face continued headwinds from the scrap gap.
In Consumer Products, net sales in Q2 were $141 million, up 20% from $118 million in the prior year quarter.
The increase was driven by the inclusion of sales from GTI, which we acquired in January, combined with higher average selling prices.
Adjusted EBIT for the consumer business was $18 million, and adjusted EBIT margin was 13% during Q2 compared to $17 million and 15% in the prior year quarter.
Consumer team continues to do an excellent job managing through a fluid environment.
Demand remains robust, and we have invested in new equipment and headcount to increase our production capacity.
Margins have been under some pressure due to higher input costs and we're limited in our ability to pass those costs along because of fixed price contracts with customers.
Late in Q2, we were able to start recapturing some of that margin.
And as a result, we expect margins will improve moving forward.
Building Products generated net sales of $121 million in Q2, which was up 29% from $94 million in the prior year quarter.
The increase was primarily due to higher volumes as construction markets continue to grow and higher average selling prices.
Building Products adjusted EBIT was $55 million, and adjusted EBIT margin was 45%, up significantly from $26 million and 28% in Q2 of last year.
The large year-over-year increase was driven by record results at ClarkDietrich, contributed $27 million in equity earnings, combined with solid results from WAVE who contributed $22 million.
Those teams have done a great job continuing to deliver value for their customers in a rising price environment.
Our wholly owned Building Products business generated 47% year-over-year EBIT growth in the quarter due to an improved demand environment and higher average selling prices.
The markets for our products and solutions, which are driven by commercial and residential construction, continue to show strength as the economy recovers, and we are maintaining and growing our share through new product development and our ability to add value to our customers' efforts.
In Sustainable Energy Solutions, net sales in Q2 were $33 million, down slightly from $34 million in the prior year.
Despite continued demand headwinds related to semiconductor chip shortages at their customers, the business was profitable and reported adjusted EBIT of $1 million in the current period compared to $2 million in the prior year.
This business is in the early stages of repositioning itself to serve the global hydrogen ecosystem and adjacent sustainable energies like compressed natural gas.
We're very pleased with our progress and some early wins.
The markets we serve will take time to develop, but we're very excited about our growth prospects over the long term.
With respect to cash flows and our balance sheet, operations used cash of $119 million in the quarter driven by a $235 million increase in operating working capital, primarily associated with higher steel prices.
For context, we've added $568 million in working capital over the last 12 months, and our free cash flow in that same period is an outflow of $201 million.
As steel prices decline, these increases in working capital should subside, and ultimately reverse, as they are converted back into cash.
During the quarter, we received $29 million in dividends from our unconsolidated JVs, invested $24 million in capital projects, paid $15 million in dividends and spent $13 million to repurchase 235,000 shares of our common stock.
Following our Q2 purchases, we have slightly over 8 million shares remaining under our repurchase authorization.
Looking at our balance sheet and liquidity position.
Funded debt at quarter end of $702 million and interest expense of $7 million were both down slightly compared to the prior year, primarily due to favorable exchange rates for our euro-denominated debt.
We ended Q2 with $225 million in cash which we used to fund our December 1 acquisition of Tempel Steel.
Earlier today, the Board declared a $0.28 per share dividend for the quarter, which is payable in March of 2022.
I'm proud of our employees for delivering yet another record quarter, the best second quarter in the company's history and the third best quarter ever.
It's a great way to finish the calendar year and enter the holiday season.
We have a lot of positive momentum in our businesses, but operating challenges remain, some of which we have been able to improve over the past few months.
Supply chain issues still exist, but the chip shortage appears to be improving, although it is still impacting our automotive volumes.
Our HR team has done excellent work reducing the number of open positions across the company but labor availability is tight and not expected to change much in the foreseeable future.
Our success is directly attributable to the efforts of our people who continue to do exceptional work meeting customer needs.
Demand levels are good across almost all of our end markets, and backlogs are solid.
In Consumer Products, price increases needed to offset rising costs are beginning to show up in our financial results and will help profitability going forward.
We continued to invest in working capital during the quarter and have added almost $600 million in the past year, but the price of hot-rolled steel peaked during the quarter in the mid-1,900s [Phonetic] and has already fallen close to $300 a ton.
Our purchasing team believes there are more declines coming, although the pace of that decline remains open for debate.
Consumer Products, Building Products and Sustainable Energy Solutions all performed well during the quarter, but a special mention to the team at ClarkDietrich, who have successfully navigated the challenging environment to record profits.
We continue to be very bullish on the future of all of these business segments as we refine and execute broader and more aggressive growth strategies.
Leveraging innovation, transformation and M&A will drive above-market growth and higher returns on capital.
We also completed our Investor Day in November.
We are thrilled to have closed the acquisition of Tempel Steel on December 1.
Tempel is already a global leader in the electrical steel laminations market, which supplies the manufacturers of transformers, electric motors and electric vehicle motors.
This business is led by a talented team and should experience significant growth in the coming years as the world converts to electric vehicles and the electricity infrastructure is upgraded and expanded to meet these demands.
The business environment continues to be very dynamic, whether it's COVID, labor shortages, supply chain issues or the volatility in commodities, particularly steel.
Our teams continue to excel in managing through these challenges safely and effectively.
Our customers' needs are being met, and our shareholders are being rewarded with record profits.
We'll now take questions.

8,"I'm Susie Lisa, senior vice president of investor relations for CVS Health.
Today's call is being broadcast on our website, where it will be archived for one year.
2021 was an important year for CVS Health.
We exceeded our financial goals.
We advanced our strategy and we brought greater value to the people we serve, playing a critical role in the nation's pandemic response.
We ended a strong 2021 with another strong quarter.
We exceeded our adjusted earnings per share expectations for the fourth quarter in a row delivering $1.98 adjusted earnings per share in the final quarter of 2021 and $8.40 adjusted earnings per share for the full year.
We are entering 2022 with powerful momentum.
We are delivering healthcare solutions that are personalized, connected, and increasingly digital.
We are engaging millions of consumers across our businesses and in our community health destinations across America.
CVS Health is becoming a bigger part of their everyday health.
Turning now to our performance.
For the full year 2021, CVS Health grew adjusted revenue by 8.8% to $292 billion.
We delivered adjusted operating income of $17.3 billion, up 8.1% year over year.
And we increased adjusted earnings per share by 12%.
We generated strong cash flow from operations of nearly $18.3 billion for the full year, exceeding our most recent guidance of at least $13.5 billion.
This strong performance positions us well for 2022.
At this early stage of the year, we are maintaining our full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $8.10 to $8.30.
Our forecast reflects increased volume from COVID testing and front store sales in our retail business relative to our forecast at investor day, offset by the accelerated timing of vaccine boosters pulled into the fourth quarter of 2021.
Shawn will provide more details on our results and guidance shortly.
Our 2021 performance demonstrates our ability to anticipate, deliver, and exceed consumers' expectations for healthcare.
Consumers are a major force driving change in healthcare, and we continue to engage successfully with individuals in more places and on their terms, virtually, in the home, and in their local community.
Customers and clients continue to realize the superior value we are providing with our integrated health solutions, particularly those that address the most prevalent, costly, and complex health conditions, such as diabetes, cancer, and chronic kidney disease.
Turning to the segment highlights.
In healthcare benefits, we delivered 9.4% adjusted revenue growth for the full year 2021, driven by our performance in government services.
We had another strong year of Medicare growth with increases across all product lines.
Total Medicare Advantage membership grew at 9.8% on a year-over-year basis, as we added over 265,000 new members in 2021 and exceeded our initial growth expectations.
As a result of our strategic focus on dual-eligible special needs plans, enrollment nearly doubled in 2021.
Our full year medical benefit ratio of 85% was in line with our guidance expectations.
For the full year 2021, the utilization of total healthcare services in aggregate was in line with normalized historical baseline levels.
Turning to 2022, we had an impressive annual enrollment period in our Medicare business.
For the second consecutive year, we grew all Medicare product lines, and our growth rates this year exceed the industry averages in all categories.
We grew total Medicare Advantage membership by 11.6% versus the prior year, reflecting increases in individual and group Medicare Advantage of over 15% and 6%, respectively, year over year.
We also led the industry in absolute Medicare PDP net membership growth.
This added nearly 295,000 net new members, while the overall PDP market continues to decline.
We had a solid 2022 selling season in our national accounts commercial business.
We expect to grow membership in the low single digits for the full year and maintained strong client retention of 96%.
Our success is driven by the combination of our competitive cost structure, our integrated benefit designs, including medical and pharmacy, and products and services that utilize CVS Health capabilities, such as Transform Care Diabetes and Virtual Primary Care programs.
Membership enrollment was lower than expected in the eight ACA individual exchanges we entered this year.
We continue to build this business gradually, with select geographic expansion, a focused price discipline, and the appeal of co-branded Aetna CVS Health offerings.
Consistent with our prior guidance, we do not expect this offering to contribute materially to our financial results in 2022.
Overall, our deep understanding of consumer needs, innovative product portfolio, and our service excellence will drive growth in our healthcare benefits segment.
Our comprehensive range of products and benefit design that address consumers' whole health needs remains a key differentiator and fueled a strong selling season.
For 2022, we forecast 7% to 9% revenue growth and 15% to 17% adjusted operating income growth.
Turning to pharmacy services, we delivered 7.8% revenue and 20.6% adjusted operating income growth in 2021.
We continue to be a consultative partner to our clients and members.
We're delivering industry-leading cost trends and savings, service excellence and a broad product portfolio, and a commitment to transparency.
We consistently create value for our customers and clients with our better-than-market drug trend.
We continue to enhance our utilization programs to ensure access to the therapeutics that are the most clinically appropriate.
For 2022, we achieved a client retention rate of over 98% and drove $8.8 billion of net new business revenue.
We are a leader in specialty pharmacy, delivering revenue growth of 12.3% for the fourth quarter and 9.3% for the full year versus prior period.
Our specialty pharmacy programs drive value in the marketplace and they differentiate us as we pair programs with digital capabilities to deliver a convenient and connected experience.
For pharmacy services in 2022, we expect 6% to 8% revenue growth and 7% to 9% adjusted operating income growth, as we create long-term value for our clients and our members.
Our retail segment plays a critical role as a community health destination for millions of Americans.
This segment outperformed the industry and our expectations in 2021.
We grew revenue 9.8% year over year to just over $100 billion, marking an important milestone in the history of this CVS Health business.
We delivered an exceptional 24% adjusted operating income growth in 2021.
Pharmacy sales and prescriptions filled both increased by nearly 9% year over year.
This was notably driven by consumers who came to CVS Health for COVID-19 vaccine administration.
For the full year 2021, CVS Health administered more than 32 million COVID-19 tests and more than 59 million vaccines.
Over 35% of COVID-19 vaccines in 2021 were administered during the fourth quarter.
Our work to test and vaccinate America for COVID is a powerful example of the relationships we are building with consumers, which leads to new customers seeking a range of other health services at CVS Health.
Front store sales growth was strong throughout 2021, up 8.4% versus the prior year.
They were led by consumer demand for the over-the-counter COVID-19 tests, as well as cough and cold, beauty, and personal care products.
We sold over 22 million OTC COVID-19 tests with approximately 70% of sales in the fourth quarter.
We are progressing on optimizing our retail portfolio and pivoting our stores into three formats: primary care clinics, enhanced health hubs, and traditional CVS pharmacy locations.
We are executing our plan to dedensify stores based on consumer health and buying needs, omnichannel preferences, and shifts in the U.S. population.
For 2022, as I mentioned, given the earnings outperformance and pull-forward of vaccine boosters in 2021, we are maintaining our 2022 guidance.
This now implies retail revenue to be plus or minus 1% versus prior year, and a low 20% decline in adjusted operating income growth.
Shawn will provide more details.
Our digital approach is focused on delivering a superior experience for consumers by creating a more connected and seamless health journey.
We are making progress toward setting a new standard for digital healthcare for consumers.
CVS.com is one of the top health websites with over 2 billion visits in 2021, up nearly 55% over the prior year.
Our digital capabilities for health interactions such as COVID testing and vaccines, prescription services, and sales of health and wellness products have dramatically increased consumer engagement across all CVS Health businesses.
We now serve 40 million customers digitally, up approximately 10% in the last six months alone.
In 2021, we launched several new digital health services powered by advanced analytics to personalize the experience.
We made it easier to join our CarePass program reaching 5.6 million subscribers in the quarter, up more than 40% year over year.
We integrated CarePass for our Aetna Commercial members and are excited about the adoption we are seeing.
We also simplified the CarePass enrollment for all consumers, which is driving more growth in subscribers.
For our HealthHUB and MinuteClinic patients, we simplified and digitized the check-in process for patients.
Our self-service digital tool enables individuals to complete traditional paperwork in advance of their appointment.
Almost 80% of patients are already utilizing this capability.
At our investor day, we promised a superior healthcare experience for consumers that will improve health outcomes, lower cost, and provide broader access to care.
We are making several moves to realize our vision for healthcare.
We're advancing our care delivery capabilities, optimizing our retail portfolio, and further diversifying the health products and services that we offer.
We're driving this evolution both through internal initiatives and by seeking to execute capability-focused M&A for complementary health services.
We will connect consumers in more places in more ways and on their terms, with our digital-first technology-forward approach, as well as an enhanced omnichannel health experience.
These strategic moves will accelerate the growth of our foundational businesses.
In all this work, we will place the consumer at the center of all that we do.
We remain focused on delivering on our commitment to sustainability for our shareholders, our customers, and our communities.
We recently launched CVS Health Zones, aim to advance health equity and to address social determinants of health in high-risk communities.
We are collaborating with trusted national and local organizations to confront the six key social determinants of health through local investments.
Our goal is to equip communities with the resources needed to close gaps in care for specific health conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease.
Health Zones is now active in five geographies with additional markets planned in 2022.
We remain committed to the environment and have pledged to reduce our overall impact, cutting greenhouse gas emissions across our operations and supply chain, and decreasing resource consumption, especially paper and plastic.
In December, CVS Health was named to the 2021 S&P Dow Jones Sustainability North American Index for the 9th consecutive year and the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the third consecutive year.
Our financial performance, execution, portfolio of assets, and differentiated strategy all create strong momentum into 2022 and a clear pathway to achieve low double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth over time.
I would also like to take a moment to recognize the continued contribution of our colleagues who have played a vital role in helping our nation prevail over the pandemic.
I am proud of what we have done and are doing every day to make a difference.
Our fourth quarter results reflect the continuation of the strong performance delivered in the first three quarters of the year, as we once again exceeded our expectations for revenue, cash flow, and adjusted earnings per share.
We maintained our focus on growth, operational execution, and supporting the communities we serve as the effects of the pandemic persists.
Starting with the enterprise as a whole.
Total fourth quarter adjusted revenues of 76.6 billion, increased by 10.6% year over year.
We reported adjusted operating income of 4.1 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.98, representing an increase of 40.8% and 52.3% versus prior year, respectively.
For full year 2021, we reported total adjusted revenues of 292.1 billion, an increase of 8.8% versus prior year, reflecting robust growth across all business segments.
We delivered adjusted operating income of 17.3 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $8.40, up approximately 8.1% and 12% year over year, respectively.
And we generated significant cash flow from operations of nearly 18.3 billion.
This marks a record year of cash flow from operations for CVS Health and reflects the strength of our financial results, accelerated collections, and focused improvements in our working capital position.
Turning to the healthcare benefits segment.
Fourth quarter adjusted revenue of 20.7 billion increased by 10.1% year over year, driven by membership growth in our government services business and lower COVID-19-related investments, slightly offset by the repeal of the health insurer fee.
Adjusted operating income of 510 million grew by over 230% year over year, driven by lower COVID-19 related investments and improved underlying performance, partially offset by higher COVID-related medical costs compared to prior year.
Our adjusted medical benefit ratio of 87% improved 130 basis points year over year, driven by lower COVID-19 related investments, partially offset by the repeal of the health insurer fee.
As a result of the omicron variant, we experienced higher COVID testing and treatment costs in the fourth quarter, but this was largely offset by lower non-COVID costs, particularly in Medicare and Medicaid.
Days claims payable at the end of the quarter was 49 and was, as expected, lower than the third quarter and consistent with normal seasonal trends and historic levels.
Overall, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves.
In the pharmacy services segment, fourth quarter revenues of 39.3 billion increased by 8.2% year over year, driven by increased pharmacy claims volume, growth in specialty pharmacy, and brand inflation, partially offset by the impact of continued client price improvements.
Total pharmacy membership increased by approximately 400,000 lives sequentially, reflecting sustained growth in government programs.
Total pharmacy claims processed increased by 8.2% above prior year.
Approximately half of this growth was attributable to net new business in 2021, with COVID-19 vaccine administration and new therapy prescriptions also contributing to the year-over-year growth.
Adjusted operating income of $1.8 billion grew 16.8% year over year, driven by improved purchasing economics, reflecting the products and services of our group purchasing organization, and growth in specialty pharmacy.
In our retail long-term care segment, we delivered exceptional revenue and adjusted operating income growth versus prior year and once again exceeded our expectations.
Fourth quarter revenue of 27.1 billion was up by 12.7% year over year, representing an increase of 3 billion.
There are two main components to this increase: one, approximately 60% was driven by the administration of COVID-19 vaccines and testing; front store sales, including demand for over-the-counter COVID test kits and related treatment categories; as well as strong COVID-related prescription volume.
The remaining 40% was attributable to a combination of underlying sustained pharmacy growth and broad strength in front store sales trends, partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure.
This strong revenue growth helped produce adjusted operating income of 2.5 billion.
This quarterly result was 38% above prior year and significantly exceeded our forecasts.
The increase in adjusted operating income was driven by a few key components: the administration of COVID-19 vaccines, underlying strength in pharmacy and front store sales, and a $106 million gain from an antitrust legal settlement, which were partially offset by the combined impacts of ongoing but stable reimbursement pressure, and business investments, including the minimum wage increase and store improvements.
In terms of the improved performance in the quarter versus our expectations, there are two primary components.
Approximately 75% was driven by vaccines, largely third-dose boosters, which we previously expected to impact the first quarter of 2022.
And the remaining 25% was driven by the nationwide surge in demand for over-the-counter and diagnostic COVID-19 testing, combined with stronger underlying front store sales performance.
Looking at cash flow and the balance sheet.
Our liquidity and capital position remained strong at the end of the fourth quarter with full year cash flow from operations of nearly 18.3 billion and nonrestricted cash of over 3.8 billion.
Through our proactive liability management transaction in December, we paid down 2.3 billion in long-term debt in the quarter, bringing the total long-term debt we have repaid since the close of the Aetna transaction to a net total of 21 billion.
In addition, we returned over 2.6 billion to shareholders through our quarterly dividends in 2021.
Our consistent outperformance during 2021 provides solid momentum as we head into this year, setting the stage for our continued strong outlook in 2022 despite multiple COVID unknowns that remain challenging to predict, such as additional variants, vaccine and testing protocols, and government testing initiatives.
As Karen noted earlier, we are maintaining our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $8.10 to $8.30.
We feel this is an appropriate stance at this early point in the year, especially given the earnings outperformance of retail in Q4 was due largely to the pull-forward of third-dose vaccine administration from 2022 into 2021.
This represents 2% to 5% growth versus our revised 2021, adjusted earnings per share baseline of $7.92.
As you think about the adjusted earnings per share baseline and year-over-year growth, I'd like to encourage you to keep a few things in mind.
First, recall that our 2021 baseline of $7.92 removes items we do not forecast, prior year's development, net of profits returned to customers and net realized capital gains.
It also includes the annualized impact of our investment in our colleagues through an increase in minimum wage.
Second, it is also important to note that the baseline now includes a net favorable component attributable to COVID-19, driven by vaccines and testing of approximately $0.30 per share.
CVS Health continues to help lead the nation's COVID-19 pandemic response, clearly demonstrating the power of our integrated business model, consumer engagement, and local community health destinations.
While there is no change to our Retail segment guidance, I would like to provide more detail on our COVID-19 retail volume assumptions for 2022.
We expect that COVID-19 testing both in-store diagnostic and over-the-counter will continue at higher volumes than anticipated at investor day, offset by a reduced outlook on vaccines.
In 2022, we expect vaccine volumes to decline approximately 70% to 80% and in-store diagnostic testing volumes to decline 40% to 50% compared to 2021.
For over-the-counter test kits, we expect modest full-year volume growth versus 2021.
Relative to vaccines, our outlook does not assume any impact from the administration of a fourth COVID-19 booster.
As such, we expect the contribution of COVID-19 vaccines to be more heavily weighted to the first half of the year.
As I mentioned, the impact of COVID-19 remains one of the most challenging aspects of developing our guidance due to many factors, including the risk of additional surges, potential new testing or vaccine protocols, legislative changes, and OTC test kit dynamics such as supply challenges, coverage mandates, and government initiatives.
Turning to items that are below adjusted operating income on our income statement, we expect our interest expense for 2022 to be approximately $2.3 billion.
We are purchasing shares to offset dilution.
And as a result, we expect that diluted share count to be approximately flat versus 2021.
Our expectation for the effective income tax rate is approximately 25.6%, consistent with 2021.
In terms of cash flow and capital deployment, we anticipate continued strong cash flow from operations in 2022.
And we are updating our guidance range to $12 billion to $13 billion, reflecting the improved cash flow results for 2021.
Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $2.8 billion to $3 billion as we invest in technology and digital enhancements to improve the consumer experience, as well as our community locations.
As we detailed in December, we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade ratings, while also having the flexibility to deploy capital strategically for capability-focused M&A.
To conclude, the strong 2021 performance of CVS Health is expected to carry into 2022 as we continue to execute our strategy.
We have solidified our leadership role in healthcare delivery as a trusted partner to our consumers and their communities.
As we build upon this trust, we will continue to drive meaningful improvements that lower the cost of care, improve access and build engagement and convenience, ultimately enabling people to live healthier lives.

We exceeded our financial goals.
We advanced our strategy and we brought greater value to the people we serve, playing a critical role in the nation's pandemic response.
We ended a strong 2021 with another strong quarter.
We exceeded our adjusted earnings per share expectations for the fourth quarter in a row delivering $1.98 adjusted earnings per share in the final quarter of 2021 and $8.40 adjusted earnings per share for the full year.
We are entering 2022 with powerful momentum.
We are delivering healthcare solutions that are personalized, connected, and increasingly digital.
We are engaging millions of consumers across our businesses and in our community health destinations across America.
CVS Health is becoming a bigger part of their everyday health.
Turning now to our performance.
For the full year 2021, CVS Health grew adjusted revenue by 8.8% to $292 billion.
We delivered adjusted operating income of $17.3 billion, up 8.1% year over year.
And we increased adjusted earnings per share by 12%.
We generated strong cash flow from operations of nearly $18.3 billion for the full year, exceeding our most recent guidance of at least $13.5 billion.
This strong performance positions us well for 2022.
At this early stage of the year, we are maintaining our full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $8.10 to $8.30.
Our forecast reflects increased volume from COVID testing and front store sales in our retail business relative to our forecast at investor day, offset by the accelerated timing of vaccine boosters pulled into the fourth quarter of 2021.
Shawn will provide more details on our results and guidance shortly.
Our 2021 performance demonstrates our ability to anticipate, deliver, and exceed consumers' expectations for healthcare.
Consumers are a major force driving change in healthcare, and we continue to engage successfully with individuals in more places and on their terms, virtually, in the home, and in their local community.
Customers and clients continue to realize the superior value we are providing with our integrated health solutions, particularly those that address the most prevalent, costly, and complex health conditions, such as diabetes, cancer, and chronic kidney disease.
Turning to the segment highlights.
In healthcare benefits, we delivered 9.4% adjusted revenue growth for the full year 2021, driven by our performance in government services.
We had another strong year of Medicare growth with increases across all product lines.
Total Medicare Advantage membership grew at 9.8% on a year-over-year basis, as we added over 265,000 new members in 2021 and exceeded our initial growth expectations.
As a result of our strategic focus on dual-eligible special needs plans, enrollment nearly doubled in 2021.
Our full year medical benefit ratio of 85% was in line with our guidance expectations.
For the full year 2021, the utilization of total healthcare services in aggregate was in line with normalized historical baseline levels.
Turning to 2022, we had an impressive annual enrollment period in our Medicare business.
For the second consecutive year, we grew all Medicare product lines, and our growth rates this year exceed the industry averages in all categories.
We grew total Medicare Advantage membership by 11.6% versus the prior year, reflecting increases in individual and group Medicare Advantage of over 15% and 6%, respectively, year over year.
We also led the industry in absolute Medicare PDP net membership growth.
This added nearly 295,000 net new members, while the overall PDP market continues to decline.
We had a solid 2022 selling season in our national accounts commercial business.
We expect to grow membership in the low single digits for the full year and maintained strong client retention of 96%.
Our success is driven by the combination of our competitive cost structure, our integrated benefit designs, including medical and pharmacy, and products and services that utilize CVS Health capabilities, such as Transform Care Diabetes and Virtual Primary Care programs.
Membership enrollment was lower than expected in the eight ACA individual exchanges we entered this year.
We continue to build this business gradually, with select geographic expansion, a focused price discipline, and the appeal of co-branded Aetna CVS Health offerings.
Consistent with our prior guidance, we do not expect this offering to contribute materially to our financial results in 2022.
Overall, our deep understanding of consumer needs, innovative product portfolio, and our service excellence will drive growth in our healthcare benefits segment.
Our comprehensive range of products and benefit design that address consumers' whole health needs remains a key differentiator and fueled a strong selling season.
For 2022, we forecast 7% to 9% revenue growth and 15% to 17% adjusted operating income growth.
Turning to pharmacy services, we delivered 7.8% revenue and 20.6% adjusted operating income growth in 2021.
We continue to be a consultative partner to our clients and members.
We're delivering industry-leading cost trends and savings, service excellence and a broad product portfolio, and a commitment to transparency.
We consistently create value for our customers and clients with our better-than-market drug trend.
We continue to enhance our utilization programs to ensure access to the therapeutics that are the most clinically appropriate.
For 2022, we achieved a client retention rate of over 98% and drove $8.8 billion of net new business revenue.
We are a leader in specialty pharmacy, delivering revenue growth of 12.3% for the fourth quarter and 9.3% for the full year versus prior period.
Our specialty pharmacy programs drive value in the marketplace and they differentiate us as we pair programs with digital capabilities to deliver a convenient and connected experience.
For pharmacy services in 2022, we expect 6% to 8% revenue growth and 7% to 9% adjusted operating income growth, as we create long-term value for our clients and our members.
Our retail segment plays a critical role as a community health destination for millions of Americans.
This segment outperformed the industry and our expectations in 2021.
We grew revenue 9.8% year over year to just over $100 billion, marking an important milestone in the history of this CVS Health business.
We delivered an exceptional 24% adjusted operating income growth in 2021.
Pharmacy sales and prescriptions filled both increased by nearly 9% year over year.
This was notably driven by consumers who came to CVS Health for COVID-19 vaccine administration.
For the full year 2021, CVS Health administered more than 32 million COVID-19 tests and more than 59 million vaccines.
Over 35% of COVID-19 vaccines in 2021 were administered during the fourth quarter.
Our work to test and vaccinate America for COVID is a powerful example of the relationships we are building with consumers, which leads to new customers seeking a range of other health services at CVS Health.
Front store sales growth was strong throughout 2021, up 8.4% versus the prior year.
They were led by consumer demand for the over-the-counter COVID-19 tests, as well as cough and cold, beauty, and personal care products.
We sold over 22 million OTC COVID-19 tests with approximately 70% of sales in the fourth quarter.
We are progressing on optimizing our retail portfolio and pivoting our stores into three formats: primary care clinics, enhanced health hubs, and traditional CVS pharmacy locations.
We are executing our plan to dedensify stores based on consumer health and buying needs, omnichannel preferences, and shifts in the U.S. population.
For 2022, as I mentioned, given the earnings outperformance and pull-forward of vaccine boosters in 2021, we are maintaining our 2022 guidance.
This now implies retail revenue to be plus or minus 1% versus prior year, and a low 20% decline in adjusted operating income growth.
Shawn will provide more details.
Our digital approach is focused on delivering a superior experience for consumers by creating a more connected and seamless health journey.
We are making progress toward setting a new standard for digital healthcare for consumers.
CVS.com is one of the top health websites with over 2 billion visits in 2021, up nearly 55% over the prior year.
Our digital capabilities for health interactions such as COVID testing and vaccines, prescription services, and sales of health and wellness products have dramatically increased consumer engagement across all CVS Health businesses.
We now serve 40 million customers digitally, up approximately 10% in the last six months alone.
In 2021, we launched several new digital health services powered by advanced analytics to personalize the experience.
We made it easier to join our CarePass program reaching 5.6 million subscribers in the quarter, up more than 40% year over year.
We integrated CarePass for our Aetna Commercial members and are excited about the adoption we are seeing.
We also simplified the CarePass enrollment for all consumers, which is driving more growth in subscribers.
For our HealthHUB and MinuteClinic patients, we simplified and digitized the check-in process for patients.
Our self-service digital tool enables individuals to complete traditional paperwork in advance of their appointment.
Almost 80% of patients are already utilizing this capability.
At our investor day, we promised a superior healthcare experience for consumers that will improve health outcomes, lower cost, and provide broader access to care.
We are making several moves to realize our vision for healthcare.
We're advancing our care delivery capabilities, optimizing our retail portfolio, and further diversifying the health products and services that we offer.
We're driving this evolution both through internal initiatives and by seeking to execute capability-focused M&A for complementary health services.
We will connect consumers in more places in more ways and on their terms, with our digital-first technology-forward approach, as well as an enhanced omnichannel health experience.
These strategic moves will accelerate the growth of our foundational businesses.
In all this work, we will place the consumer at the center of all that we do.
We remain focused on delivering on our commitment to sustainability for our shareholders, our customers, and our communities.
We recently launched CVS Health Zones, aim to advance health equity and to address social determinants of health in high-risk communities.
We are collaborating with trusted national and local organizations to confront the six key social determinants of health through local investments.
Our goal is to equip communities with the resources needed to close gaps in care for specific health conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease.
Health Zones is now active in five geographies with additional markets planned in 2022.
We remain committed to the environment and have pledged to reduce our overall impact, cutting greenhouse gas emissions across our operations and supply chain, and decreasing resource consumption, especially paper and plastic.
In December, CVS Health was named to the 2021 S&P Dow Jones Sustainability North American Index for the 9th consecutive year and the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the third consecutive year.
Our financial performance, execution, portfolio of assets, and differentiated strategy all create strong momentum into 2022 and a clear pathway to achieve low double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth over time.
I would also like to take a moment to recognize the continued contribution of our colleagues who have played a vital role in helping our nation prevail over the pandemic.
I am proud of what we have done and are doing every day to make a difference.
Our fourth quarter results reflect the continuation of the strong performance delivered in the first three quarters of the year, as we once again exceeded our expectations for revenue, cash flow, and adjusted earnings per share.
We maintained our focus on growth, operational execution, and supporting the communities we serve as the effects of the pandemic persists.
Starting with the enterprise as a whole.
Total fourth quarter adjusted revenues of 76.6 billion, increased by 10.6% year over year.
We reported adjusted operating income of 4.1 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.98, representing an increase of 40.8% and 52.3% versus prior year, respectively.
For full year 2021, we reported total adjusted revenues of 292.1 billion, an increase of 8.8% versus prior year, reflecting robust growth across all business segments.
We delivered adjusted operating income of 17.3 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $8.40, up approximately 8.1% and 12% year over year, respectively.
And we generated significant cash flow from operations of nearly 18.3 billion.
This marks a record year of cash flow from operations for CVS Health and reflects the strength of our financial results, accelerated collections, and focused improvements in our working capital position.
Turning to the healthcare benefits segment.
Fourth quarter adjusted revenue of 20.7 billion increased by 10.1% year over year, driven by membership growth in our government services business and lower COVID-19-related investments, slightly offset by the repeal of the health insurer fee.
Adjusted operating income of 510 million grew by over 230% year over year, driven by lower COVID-19 related investments and improved underlying performance, partially offset by higher COVID-related medical costs compared to prior year.
Our adjusted medical benefit ratio of 87% improved 130 basis points year over year, driven by lower COVID-19 related investments, partially offset by the repeal of the health insurer fee.
As a result of the omicron variant, we experienced higher COVID testing and treatment costs in the fourth quarter, but this was largely offset by lower non-COVID costs, particularly in Medicare and Medicaid.
Days claims payable at the end of the quarter was 49 and was, as expected, lower than the third quarter and consistent with normal seasonal trends and historic levels.
Overall, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves.
In the pharmacy services segment, fourth quarter revenues of 39.3 billion increased by 8.2% year over year, driven by increased pharmacy claims volume, growth in specialty pharmacy, and brand inflation, partially offset by the impact of continued client price improvements.
Total pharmacy membership increased by approximately 400,000 lives sequentially, reflecting sustained growth in government programs.
Total pharmacy claims processed increased by 8.2% above prior year.
Approximately half of this growth was attributable to net new business in 2021, with COVID-19 vaccine administration and new therapy prescriptions also contributing to the year-over-year growth.
Adjusted operating income of $1.8 billion grew 16.8% year over year, driven by improved purchasing economics, reflecting the products and services of our group purchasing organization, and growth in specialty pharmacy.
In our retail long-term care segment, we delivered exceptional revenue and adjusted operating income growth versus prior year and once again exceeded our expectations.
Fourth quarter revenue of 27.1 billion was up by 12.7% year over year, representing an increase of 3 billion.
There are two main components to this increase: one, approximately 60% was driven by the administration of COVID-19 vaccines and testing; front store sales, including demand for over-the-counter COVID test kits and related treatment categories; as well as strong COVID-related prescription volume.
The remaining 40% was attributable to a combination of underlying sustained pharmacy growth and broad strength in front store sales trends, partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure.
This strong revenue growth helped produce adjusted operating income of 2.5 billion.
This quarterly result was 38% above prior year and significantly exceeded our forecasts.
The increase in adjusted operating income was driven by a few key components: the administration of COVID-19 vaccines, underlying strength in pharmacy and front store sales, and a $106 million gain from an antitrust legal settlement, which were partially offset by the combined impacts of ongoing but stable reimbursement pressure, and business investments, including the minimum wage increase and store improvements.
In terms of the improved performance in the quarter versus our expectations, there are two primary components.
Approximately 75% was driven by vaccines, largely third-dose boosters, which we previously expected to impact the first quarter of 2022.
And the remaining 25% was driven by the nationwide surge in demand for over-the-counter and diagnostic COVID-19 testing, combined with stronger underlying front store sales performance.
Looking at cash flow and the balance sheet.
Our liquidity and capital position remained strong at the end of the fourth quarter with full year cash flow from operations of nearly 18.3 billion and nonrestricted cash of over 3.8 billion.
Through our proactive liability management transaction in December, we paid down 2.3 billion in long-term debt in the quarter, bringing the total long-term debt we have repaid since the close of the Aetna transaction to a net total of 21 billion.
In addition, we returned over 2.6 billion to shareholders through our quarterly dividends in 2021.
Our consistent outperformance during 2021 provides solid momentum as we head into this year, setting the stage for our continued strong outlook in 2022 despite multiple COVID unknowns that remain challenging to predict, such as additional variants, vaccine and testing protocols, and government testing initiatives.
As Karen noted earlier, we are maintaining our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $8.10 to $8.30.
We feel this is an appropriate stance at this early point in the year, especially given the earnings outperformance of retail in Q4 was due largely to the pull-forward of third-dose vaccine administration from 2022 into 2021.
This represents 2% to 5% growth versus our revised 2021, adjusted earnings per share baseline of $7.92.
As you think about the adjusted earnings per share baseline and year-over-year growth, I'd like to encourage you to keep a few things in mind.
First, recall that our 2021 baseline of $7.92 removes items we do not forecast, prior year's development, net of profits returned to customers and net realized capital gains.
It also includes the annualized impact of our investment in our colleagues through an increase in minimum wage.
Second, it is also important to note that the baseline now includes a net favorable component attributable to COVID-19, driven by vaccines and testing of approximately $0.30 per share.
CVS Health continues to help lead the nation's COVID-19 pandemic response, clearly demonstrating the power of our integrated business model, consumer engagement, and local community health destinations.
While there is no change to our Retail segment guidance, I would like to provide more detail on our COVID-19 retail volume assumptions for 2022.
We expect that COVID-19 testing both in-store diagnostic and over-the-counter will continue at higher volumes than anticipated at investor day, offset by a reduced outlook on vaccines.
In 2022, we expect vaccine volumes to decline approximately 70% to 80% and in-store diagnostic testing volumes to decline 40% to 50% compared to 2021.
For over-the-counter test kits, we expect modest full-year volume growth versus 2021.
Relative to vaccines, our outlook does not assume any impact from the administration of a fourth COVID-19 booster.
As such, we expect the contribution of COVID-19 vaccines to be more heavily weighted to the first half of the year.
As I mentioned, the impact of COVID-19 remains one of the most challenging aspects of developing our guidance due to many factors, including the risk of additional surges, potential new testing or vaccine protocols, legislative changes, and OTC test kit dynamics such as supply challenges, coverage mandates, and government initiatives.
Turning to items that are below adjusted operating income on our income statement, we expect our interest expense for 2022 to be approximately $2.3 billion.
We are purchasing shares to offset dilution.
And as a result, we expect that diluted share count to be approximately flat versus 2021.
Our expectation for the effective income tax rate is approximately 25.6%, consistent with 2021.
In terms of cash flow and capital deployment, we anticipate continued strong cash flow from operations in 2022.
And we are updating our guidance range to $12 billion to $13 billion, reflecting the improved cash flow results for 2021.
Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $2.8 billion to $3 billion as we invest in technology and digital enhancements to improve the consumer experience, as well as our community locations.
As we detailed in December, we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade ratings, while also having the flexibility to deploy capital strategically for capability-focused M&A.
To conclude, the strong 2021 performance of CVS Health is expected to carry into 2022 as we continue to execute our strategy.
We have solidified our leadership role in healthcare delivery as a trusted partner to our consumers and their communities.
As we build upon this trust, we will continue to drive meaningful improvements that lower the cost of care, improve access and build engagement and convenience, ultimately enabling people to live healthier lives.

"
9,"Speaking on the call will be Ocwen's chief executive officer, Glen Messina; and chief financial officer, June Campbell.
We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide a useful supplement to analysis of our financial condition and an alternate way to view certain aspects of our business that is instructive.
Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for the company's reported results under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
These statements are based on currently available information and reflect our current estimates and assessments.
The company has not finished its fourth-quarter financial closing procedures.
There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from our current estimates and assessments, including as a result of fourth-quarter financial closing procedures and any such differences could be material.
Let's get started today on Slide 3.
We're really energized by the great progress we've made across the company.
We've executed an incredible business transformation.
We're a better balanced and more diversified mortgage originator and servicer.
We're stronger, more efficient, and better aligned with future market opportunities.
We've concluded our strategic review and are excited to announce an expansion of our strategic alliance with Oaktree Capital with their investment in OFC Holdco notes.
We believe our alliance with Oaktree can enable a level of growth and earnings per share accretion, and potential value creation that we cannot achieve on a stand-alone basis, as well as, support the refinancing of our corporate debt.
In the fourth quarter, we continued to improve profitability.
We delivered record growth in originations and we continued to reshape and diversify our servicing portfolio.
As we look ahead, we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on potential future growth opportunities in multiple market segments and we're focused on executing five straightforward operating objectives to drive improved value for shareholders.
Let's jump to Slide 6 to discuss the outcome of our strategic review process.
Our expanded strategic alliance with Oaktree marks the conclusion to our strategic review process that we announced in May 2020.
The objective of our strategic review was to maximize long-term value for Ocwen's shareholders.
Our review of alternatives which was overseen by our board and with the support of Barclays and Credit Suisse was fulsome and robust.
Our outreach was aided by our public announcement of the strategic review process which also resulted in inbound increase by parties not included in our initial outreach.
Now we had discussions with numerous parties and all options were considered.
And at the end of the day, there were really no actionable change of control or merger opportunities that emerged from these discussions.
In the absence of a change of control transaction, we believe we need to accelerate our originations and servicing growth, and address the upcoming corporate debt maturities to maximize our value as a stand-alone company.
We concluded through our strategic review that our ability to increase the leverage of the total company using the assets of the operating company was limited by a number of factors, including proposed regulatory requirements that may increase capital and liquidity requirements for nonbank mortgage companies.
So to address our growth and refinancing objectives with these constraints, we focused our structured financing solutions that would provide incremental capital to accelerate our growth and position the company to successfully refinance our upcoming corporate debt maturities without encumbering the assets necessarily of PHH, our operating company.
We're excited to announce that we've executed definitive agreements with Oaktree for $250 million in incremental capital through Holdco notes issued by Ocwen Financial Corporation.
This is our holding company and this incremental capital is in addition to our joint venture with Oaktree MAV.
When combined with MAV, we expect the over $460 million in capital provided by Oaktree can enable us to potentially increase our earnings per share by 65% or more once the proceeds are fully invested.
We believe the Holdco notes also support our corporate debt refinancing on more favorable terms while increasing capacity for secured financing and share repurchases.
Now for these reasons, the board found the Oaktree offer to be the most compelling opportunity to enable a level of growth, earnings per share accretion, and potential long-term value creation that we could not achieve on a stand-alone basis.
We believe the Oaktree investment enhances our ability to compete and prosper, as well as, demonstrates their confidence in and commitment to Ocwen's long-term success.
Yes, starting with the Holdco notes.
These are structured with the collateral package limited to a second lien on the assets of OFC, the holding company.
There is no lien on the PHH assets or guarantees from PHH.
This is a substantially reduced collateral coverage and more deeply subordinated position in our capital structure versus our existing high-yield notes.
The limited collateral package and deep subordination enables us to treat the proceeds from the Holdco notes that gets contributed to PHH, our operating company, as equity.
And we expect this will increase our ability to leverage the assets of PHH with first lien debt and secured financing.
You know this deeply subordinated position in our capital structure relating to the Holdco notes does translate into pricing that's close to equity.
The Oaktree notes have a face value of $285 million with a $35 million original issue discount for net proceeds of $250 million.
The coupon is 12%, plus about 2% for the effective annual cost of the OID.
In addition, Oaktree will receive warrants for 12% of the fully diluted shares of Ocwen.
In terms of use of proceeds, we intend to use $100 million of the proceeds to pay down and support the refinancing of our existing corporate debt in a concurrent refinancing transaction.
We expect less restrictive covenants, eliminating amortization, and relative to existing corporate debt, extending the maturity with an expected tenure of six years on the Holdco notes.
Concurrent with the refinancing, we'll pay off our existing corporate debt per their respective terms.
The remaining $150 million in proceeds from the Holdco notes will be used to support our on book growth objectives through MSR purchases and funding a portion of the MAV investment.
We do expect the incremental capital in the operating company will allow us to improve the terms of our existing MSR financing which can create up to about $75 million in additional capital from our existing MSRs.
The proceeds from Oaktree will come in two tranches.
The first tranche is $175 million and that will come in concurrently with the closing of the corporate debt refinancing.
The remaining $75 million will come in concurrent with the closing of MAV.
Moving on to MAV.
As we announced in December, we formed a partnership joint venture with Oaktree Capital to launch an MSR asset vehicle.
This vehicle will purchase MSRs.
Oaktree will own 85% and Ocwen will own 15%.
You know, MAV expects to leverage up to $250 million in capital that will be contributed by Oaktree and Ocwen, respectively, based on our relative shares to purchase MSRs and this will be leveraged up roughly one for one with secured MSR financing.
So that gives us the capacity for up to about $60 billion in MSR UPB.
Now PHH will be the sole provider of originations, subservicing, and recaptured administrative services to MAV.
And Ocwen will also earn MSR investment returns on its capital contribution and from profit sharing on returns in MAV above 12%.
Now MAV is expected to close in the first half of 2021, subject to GSE and regulatory approvals.
In terms of benefits, MAV supports our servicing and subservicing growth objectives on a capital-efficient basis and will help generate increased cost efficiency through increased origination and servicing scale.
Moving on to Slide 8.
In terms of the financial impact of the Oaktree investment in Ocwen, we estimate that a -- on a combined basis, the Holdco notes and MAV can contribute up to $78 million in annualized pre-tax income from full deployment of the capital provided by these two structures.
We estimate full deployment of the proceeds can generate roughly $5 per share in incremental earnings on a fully diluted basis.
This translates to over a 65% increase above our potential baseline earnings per share range which assumes an after-tax ROE range of roughly 10% to 15% on about $414 million of equity.
Using a PE multiple range of some of our peers of roughly 4 times to 6 times forward earnings, the potential incremental value creation is roughly $20 to $30 per share.
This is a 7 times to 10 times multiple of the potential book value per share dilution, assuming the warrants are fully issued and the corresponding increase to our equity from the proceeds related to issuing the warrants.
The incremental investment capital will allow us to further expand our originations activities and expand our participation in the bulk purchase market.
We expect to source roughly up to $200 billion in incremental total volume over the next couple of years.
And again, it's estimated to source up to $200 billion in incremental volume over the next two years.
The total growth in volume will allow us to grow our total subservicing portfolio to roughly $300 billion by the end of 2022, assuming the NRZ subservicing contract does not renew.
So again, strong growth in the servicing portfolio resulting from the originations.
We believe it's a great time to invest in MSRs.
Pretax cash IRRs in our MSRs generated in December were about 12% before MSR financing, that translates to roughly 18% after MSR secured financing.
Now in addition, we'll continue to opportunistically evaluate M&A transactions to expand our originations and servicing capabilities which might provide enhanced returns versus MSR investments.
These estimates are based on the judgment of management and based on our current assumptions which may be subject to change based on market and industry conditions, among other things.
Look, the bottom line here is, we're really excited about our alliance with Oaktree and the opportunity it provides to enable a level of growth and earnings per share accretion and potential value creation that we could not achieve on a stand-alone basis.
Moving on to Slide 9, maybe a little bit about the fourth quarter.
So look, during 2020, we demonstrated exponential total volume growth, total cost improvement and built a scalable and efficient platform to support our future growth.
Adjusted pre-tax profitability was up roughly 15% in the fourth quarter over the third quarter despite declining origination margins.
Annualized adjusted pre-tax profitability has improved over $380 million over the second-quarter 2018 baseline for Ocwen and PHH combined.
Our multichannel origination platform continued to deliver really strong results.
Flow origination volume in the fourth quarter was up 49% over the third quarter and up over 7 times as compared to 2019.
So again, just really great performance by the originations team.
And as we talked about earlier, we're focused on accelerating our growth trajectory in 2021.
Yeah, we are focused on driving efficiency in our operating expenses.
And as a result of that efficiency and our continuous cost improvement, operating expenses are down 44% over the second-quarter 2018 baseline for Ocwen and PHH combined.
That's over a $400 million cost reduction.
So again, just great performance by the team in really rethinking and reimagining our business infrastructure.
You know, we're disappointed that settlement discussions with the CFPB did not resolve this matter and especially since we've resolved all state regulatory actions filed against Ocwen in 2017.
We engaged with the bureau in good faith throughout the course of mediation and numerous related discussions and took all actions in an attempt to reach a fair and reasonable resolution.
We increased our legal and regulatory accrual related to the CFPB matter by $13 million in the fourth quarter, resulting from our efforts to resolve the matter in mediation.
We remain steadfast in our belief that the CFPB's claims regarding Ocwen's past servicing practice are unsubstantiated and the bureau settlement demands do not reflect the merits of this case.
While we remain committed to attempting to resolve the matter prior to trial, our pending motion for summary judgment which was filed on June 5th, 2020, supports our position on this matter, and we expect to continually -- continue to vigorously defend ourselves going forward.
Look, it was a great quarter, the fourth quarter, a great year in 2020, and I could not be proud of the team of what they accomplished.
Yeah, moving to Slide 10.
Maybe a little bit about the originations platform.
We delivered a record total volume of $30 billion in the fourth quarter.
It translates to roughly an annualized run rate of about $60 billion from our flow channels and about $60 billion annualized from bulk.
Total volume for 2020 was $59 billion versus $26 billion last year, so we've doubled total volume.
Full-year flow and co-issue originations were up 8 times over last year.
Full-year bulk and subservicing adds were up over 48% as compared to last year.
Our correspondent and flow seller base increased about threefold since the fourth quarter of 2019.
You know, all of our channels delivered strong double-digit growth quarter over quarter.
As I mentioned before, cash yields and MSRs continued to be very strong, and our portfolio replenishment was exceptional.
In addition, in the fourth quarter, we were awarded multiple subservicing contracts with projected volume of $16 billion to $24 billion that we expect will board in the first and second quarter.
Now margins as well continued to contract in the fourth quarter.
We had expected that.
The average margins fell to about 56 basis points versus our expectation of 77 basis points for Q4.
This is really solely due to higher-than-expected third party volume.
Margin compression by each channel was actually slightly less than expected.
Again, here, great performance by our originations and capital markets teams and I believe we've got more room to grow.
We'll talk about that in a minute.
Turning to Slide 11.
Our servicing platform continued to deliver very strong performance in the fourth quarter.
Our servicing leadership team is doing a great job of driving continued improvement in efficiency and effectiveness and helping customers navigate through the crisis.
Our call center continued to outperform the MBA reported industry averages.
Our key claims metrics also continued to perform with nearly 100% effectiveness.
We continued to invest in technology to lower unit costs, improve performance for investors and enhance the customer experience.
Despite almost all of our people working remotely, we've continued our unparalleled track record of helping homeowners in need.
In 2020, we provided forbearance relief for over 180,000 consumers and we completed about 40 virtual borrower outreach events to reach consumers potentially impacted by the pandemic.
The strength of our originations have allowed us to grow our servicing portfolio slightly in the fourth quarter.
And we achieved roughly a 50-50 mix of owned servicing and subservicing.
Again, here, I'm really proud of how our servicing team has transformed their operation.
All our hard work over the last two years really positions us well for profitable growth, leveraging a scale -- a scalable and efficient platform for 2021.
Turning to Slide 12.
In 2021, looking ahead, the market, we expect the total originations will be down roughly about 17%, with much decline in the second half of the year.
You know Black Knight is reporting that there's still about 16 million to 17 million borrowers who are eligible for refinancing which should continue to drive the refi market in the near-term.
As well, the millennial generation is driving significant growth in the number of first-time potential homebuyers which should, long-term, also bode well for the purchase market.
Our reverse origination platform is positioned to support the financial needs of our growing senior population by tapping into an estimated $7.8 trillion of untapped home equity.
Our special servicing expertise and track record of creating non-foreclosure outcomes for consumers, you know, positions us to support the roughly 1.8 million homeowners who are still on forbearance who may need loss mitigation assistance.
We estimate that roughly 85% of these borrowers are delinquent and we further estimate that about 25% will need loss mitigation assistance.
We expect the increase in Ginnie Mae workouts as foreclosure alternatives will drive increased EBO, early buyout gain opportunities, in Ginnie Mae servicing, and the current low interest rate environment can create opportunities to drive increased realization of gains for executing call rights.
As most of you know, as rates rise, total industry volume will decline.
We also expect margins will contract and we've seen some of that this year.
However, rising rates can increase the value of our owned MSRs by extending duration and MSR amortization will slow as prepayments decrease.
The increase in MSR values, this rate rise will positively impact book value per share.
Turning to Slide 13.
You know, our focus for 2021 will be on executing five key business initiatives that we believe will help us capitalize on the opportunities that are available in the market ahead.
Those are accelerated growth, strengthen our recapture performance, improve our cost leadership position, maintain high-quality operational execution, and expand servicing revenue opportunities.
Yeah, from a regulatory perspective, we are monitoring and we'll continue to evaluate the impact that the Biden administration's key agenda items may have on our industry.
We'll also closely monitor -- be monitoring statements from the CFPB regarding any planned priorities or areas of focus.
And the President has already signed an Executive Order calling for various federal agencies to extend foreclosure and eviction moratoria, and the administration's enhanced stimulus plans could include additional protections with respect to forbearance and foreclosure, and eviction moratoria.
Any changes at the federal level will, obviously, be uniform across all competitors in the industry, and thus far, Ocwen alone, as well as, the industry has proven to be adaptable in a dynamic regulatory environment.
We expect the successful execution of our key initiatives will allow us to deliver positive GAAP earnings in 2021, with low double-digit to mid-teen after tax ROEs again by mid-2021, assuming no adverse changes in the market, industry or business conditions or legal and regulatory matters.
And June will take us through our road map for 2021 later.
And maybe I'd like to share a little bit more about each of these initiatives for 2021 on the next few pages.
Turning to Slide 14.
In 2021, our goal is to achieve over $100 billion in volume with the 40-60 mix of owned servicing and subservicing, respectively.
Our fourth-quarter run rate kind of puts us on track for those levels.
We focused on several actions to accelerate our growth trajectory by leveraging our multichannel platform.
Now we're targeting to grow our seller base again, over 450 sellers in 2021 to support our growth in correspondent and flow volume, as well as, performing and special subservicing opportunities.
We believe our broad portfolio of services, including subservicing, specialty servicing, MSR purchase through multiple delivery methods, provides a compelling value proposition.
We're also focused on expanding our product reach, so expanding our share in the Ginnie Mae market through correspondent, in the Ginnie Mae co-issue market and correspondent.
We're also working to introduce Jumbo and non-QM products, as well as, expanding our service to include best efforts and non-delegated delivery methods.
In subservicing, we're expanding our small balance commercial loan business.
That's begin to grow nicely for us.
And finally, MAV will allow us to expand our participation in the bulk market significantly which will help us create synthetic subservicing.
And finally, as I mentioned earlier, we continue to evaluate opportunities to enter higher-margin channels based on market conditions.
Now turning to Slide 15.
We continue to target achieving at least a 30% recapture rate for our recapture platform and we believe our recapture performance is only limited by our operating capacity to address available opportunities.
And our recapture team has consistently, over the last four or five quarters, grown our closings quarter over quarter and has marched up the recapture rate quite nicely, but we've still got more room to grow.
So we expect to increase staffing levels by over 40% through the course of 2021.
We're continuing to hire and train new team players in every position and intend to do so throughout the year.
We are focused on process and technology as well.
We're focused on helping new team players improve their productivity as they mature in their roles.
We're also driving continuous process improvement with our process improvement teams, leveraging our global workforce, and we're focused on implementing new technology to support expanding our capacity across the entire loan origination life cycle.
Yeah, moving to Slide 16.
We remain focused on driving productivity to improve our cost leadership position while maintaining high-quality operational execution.
We're targeting to reduce our servicing operating cost by roughly 2 basis points of UPB in this year and reducing corporate overhead expenses by roughly 1 basis points of UPB.
We're executing over 60 technology-enabled projects across the business to drive productivity, cost reduction, improved customer experience, and support growth.
We'll continue to focus on high-quality execution at our operations relative to comparative industry benchmarks to further improve our customer experience and create value for investors and clients.
And as we did in 2020, we stand ready to support consumers in need of forbearance relief and loss mitigation assistance as they come off forbearance.
On Slide 17, finally, we're focused here on several actions aimed to expand our servicing revenue opportunities.
We're preparing for a surge in loss mitigation related to expiring Ginnie Mae forbearance plans.
We expect this will also create a potential surge in early buyouts and modification related redelivery gains.
We're tracking roughly $300 million in RMBS call right opportunities.
We expect roughly $125 million will be eligible to call in 2021 and we'll continue to evaluate the variables that impact eligibility and economics of executing these calls throughout the year.
And finally, we continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our capabilities in both forward and reverse servicing.
This is our fifth consecutive quarter of positive adjusted pre-tax income.
Revenue decreased quarter over quarter, driven primarily by lower NRZ subservicing fees, resulting from UPB transfer and runoff.
We've been awarded multiple subservicing contracts with projected volume $16 billion to $24 billion and closed approximately $15 billion of MSR bulk purchases which should largely offset the lost revenue.
MSR adjustment decrease is driven by fair value calibration for higher one-off which reduced the fair value of MSRs in the third quarter.
We also recorded $3 million of higher gain during the quarter, largely driven by higher MSR purchase volumes.
Operating expense improvement is from leveraging technology and productivity actions as we continued to invest in our originations platform.
Adjusted pre-tax income is $15 million, $2 million higher than prior quarter, as favorable MSR valuation and lower expenses offset lower revenue.
Notables in the fourth quarter include a $13 million additional CFPB accrual and $4 million in other legal accruals.
We had higher income tax expense during the quarter which excludes tax benefit on fourth-quarter legal accruals which we expect to recognize when paid in 2021 and fourth-quarter period adjustment to the CARES Act benefit for higher pre-tax income than previously estimated for the year.
We reported a GAAP net loss of $7 million, $2 million improvement over prior quarter and after the $13 million of additional CFPB accrual I previously mentioned.
Our balanced business model is operating well.
Originations growth and profitability is replenishing the servicing portfolio and offsetting one-offs.
On the left side of the slide, you can see that our multichannel platform is fueling strong originations volume with growth up 164% quarter over quarter.
Servicing originated volume is up almost 4 times quarter over quarter, driving strong replenishment of 267%.
Adjusted pre-tax income was $35 million, $2 million lower than the prior quarter as higher volume was offset by expected margin normalization and $5 million of investment in our platform.
On the right side of the slide, our servicing segment is demonstrating strong performance through the refinance cycle, delivering improved results quarter over quarter.
UPB runoff is being replenished through newly originated servicing and subservicing despite a $16 billion transfer of the NRZ portfolio previously terminated in 2020.
We have a strong subservicing pipeline with our top 15 prospects at approximately $85 billion, with additional opportunities from MAV.
We continue to optimize our cost structure through rigorous process redesign and increased automation, driving improved efficiency.
Our total exposure to loans on forbearance continues to diminish and tracks favorable to our forecast.
You can see on the left that both the total number of forbearance plans and the forbearance plans where we have ultimate responsibility to advance continue to decline.
As the chart reflects, there's a significant difference between total forbearance plans and the amount where we have ultimate responsibility to advance.
This is a function and a benefit from our strategy to maintain a mix of owned servicing and subservicing.
On the upper right chart, you can see that our owned servicing portfolio is performing favorable to other nonbank servicers in terms of percent of loans on forbearance.
We are seeing roughly 53% of our borrowers on maturing forbearance plans reinstate and 40% extend.
Roughly 4% have progressed to loss mitigation and we are awaiting decision for direction from the borrower on about 3% of plans that have matured.
Our expectation is roughly 75% of borrowers on forbearance will reinstate and less than 25% will need some form of loss assistance.
We ended the quarter with $285 million in liquidity.
We have made significant investments in bulk MSR market opportunities and originations during the quarter.
We invested $190 million in cash before financing to fund $25 billion of MSR originations, $18 billion higher than the prior quarter, largely driven by opportunistic bulk MSR acquisitions.
Our originations generated strong cash-on-cash unlevered yields of approximately 12% across all channels.
Servicing advances continue to track favorably and actual advances were 29% lower than forecast.
Lower advance originations were largely driven by higher prepayments and more forbearance plans performing.
We're focused on our five operating objectives, as highlighted by Glen earlier to achieve our profitability goals.
We expect to generate positive GAAP earnings in 2021 with low- to mid-teen after-tax ROE by mid-2021.
This page is a road map to achieving these results broken down by operating objectives in originations, servicing, and corporate segments.
I won't go through the details on the call here today, but please let me know if you'd like to review at another time as we have to go through the details.
You know, wrap up, let's turn to Page 24.
As I said at the onset, I'm just energized about the opportunities and our potential for 2021 and beyond.
We've radically transformed Ocwen.
It's a better balanced, diversified mortgage originator and servicer.
Our strategic alliance with Oaktree can provide almost $0.5 billion of incremental capital to enable a level of growth, earnings per share accretion, and potential value creation that we could just not achieve on a stand-alone basis.
We're stronger, more efficient, and better aligned to future market opportunities as a result of all the hard work of the Ocwen global team.
We're delivering record growth in originations and we continue to reshape and diversify our servicing portfolio.
As we look to the opportunities ahead, we believe we're fairly well-positioned to capitalize on the potential future growth opportunities in multiple market segments.
You know in 2021, we're focused on executing five straightforward objectives to drive improved value for shareholders and achieve our goal of low double-digit to mid-teen after-tax return on equities by mid-2021.
And you know, none of this would be possible without all the hard work of our global Ocwen team.

Glen Messina, chief executive officer, and June Campbell, chief financial officer, will discuss the company's fourth-quarter 2020 earnings. I'll now turn the call over to Glen.
Thank you, operator.
Good morning, everyone.
I'm very excited about the progress we've made across the company.
We've executed an incredible business transformation.
We're a better balanced and more diversified mortgage originator and servicer.
We're stronger, more efficient, and better aligned with future market opportunities.
We've concluded our strategic review and are excited to announce an expansion of our strategic alliance with Oaktree Capital with their investment in OFC Holdco notes.
We believe our alliance with Oaktree can enable a level of growth and earnings per share accretion, and potential value creation that we cannot achieve on a stand-alone basis, as well as, support the refinancing of our corporate debt.
In the fourth quarter, we continued to improve profitability.
We delivered record growth in originations and we continued to reshape and diversify our servicing portfolio.
As we look ahead, we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on potential future growth opportunities in multiple market segments and we're focused on executing five straightforward operating objectives to drive improved value for shareholders.
Let's jump to Slide 6 to discuss the outcome of our strategic review process.
Our expanded strategic alliance with Oaktree marks the conclusion to our strategic review process that we announced in May 2020.
The objective of our strategic review was to maximize long-term value for Ocwen's shareholders.
Our review of alternatives which was overseen by our board and with the support of Barclays and Credit Suisse was fulsome and robust.
Our outreach was aided by our public announcement of the strategic review process which also resulted in inbound increase by parties not included in our initial outreach.
Now we had discussions with numerous parties and all options were considered.
And at the end of the day, there were really no actionable change of control or merger opportunities that emerged from these discussions.
In the absence of a change of control transaction, we believe we need to accelerate our originations and servicing growth, and address the upcoming corporate debt maturities to maximize our value as a stand-alone company.
We concluded through our strategic review that our ability to increase the leverage of the total company using the assets of the operating company was limited by a number of factors, including proposed regulatory requirements that may increase capital and liquidity requirements for nonbank mortgage companies.
So to address our growth and refinancing objectives with these constraints, we focused our structured financing solutions that would provide incremental capital to accelerate our growth and position the company to successfully refinance our upcoming corporate debt maturities without encumbering the assets necessarily of PHH, our operating company.
We're excited to announce that we've executed definitive agreements with Oaktree for $250 million in incremental capital through Holdco notes issued by Ocwen Financial Corporation.
This is our holding company and this incremental capital is in addition to our joint venture with Oaktree MAV.
When combined with MAV, we expect the over $460 million in capital provided by Oaktree can enable us to potentially increase our earnings per share by 65% or more once the proceeds are fully invested.
We believe the Holdco notes also support our corporate debt refinancing on more favorable terms while increasing capacity for secured financing and share repurchases.
Now for these reasons, the board found the Oaktree offer to be the most compelling opportunity to enable a level of growth, earnings per share accretion, and potential long-term value creation that we could not achieve on a stand-alone basis.
We believe the Oaktree investment enhances our ability to compete and prosper, as well as, demonstrates their confidence in and commitment to Ocwen's long-term success.
Yes, starting with the Holdco notes.
These are structured with the collateral package limited to a second lien on the assets of OFC, the holding company.
There is no lien on the PHH assets or guarantees from PHH.
This is a substantially reduced collateral coverage and more deeply subordinated position in our capital structure versus our existing high-yield notes.
The limited collateral package and deep subordination enables us to treat the proceeds from the Holdco notes that gets contributed to PHH, our operating company, as equity.
And we expect this will increase our ability to leverage the assets of PHH with first lien debt and secured financing.
You know this deeply subordinated position in our capital structure relating to the Holdco notes does translate into pricing that's close to equity.
The Oaktree notes have a face value of $285 million with a $35 million original issue discount for net proceeds of $250 million.
The coupon is 12%, plus about 2% for the effective annual cost of the OID.
In addition, Oaktree will receive warrants for 12% of the fully diluted shares of Ocwen.
In terms of use of proceeds, we intend to use $100 million of the proceeds to pay down and suppor",ADC_q3_2021,"

We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide a useful supplement to analysis of our financial condition and an alternate way to view certain aspects of our business that is instructive.
Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for the company's reported results under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
These statements are based on currently available information and reflect our current estimates and assessments.
The company has not finished its fourth-quarter financial closing procedures.
There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from our current estimates and assessments, including as a result of fourth-quarter financial closing procedures and any such differences could be material.
Let's get started today on Slide 3.
We're really energized by the great progress we've made across the company.
We've executed an incredible business transformation.
We're a better balanced and more diversified mortgage originator and servicer.
We're stronger, more efficient, and better aligned with future market opportunities.

There is no lien on the PHH assets or guarantees from PHH.
This is a substantially reduced collateral coverage and more deeply subordinated position in our capital structure versus our existing high-yield notes.
The limited collateral package and deep subordination enables us to treat the proceeds from the Holdco notes that gets contributed to PHH, our operating company, as equity.
And we expect this will increase our ability to leverage the assets of PHH with first lien debt and secured financing.
You know this deeply subordinated position in our capital structure relating to the Holdco notes does translate into pricing that's close to equity.
The Oaktree notes have a face value of $285 million with a $35 million original issue discount for net proceeds of $250 million.
The coupon is 12%, plus about 2% for the effective annual cost of the OID.
In addition, Oaktree will receive warrants for 12% of the fully diluted shares of Ocwen.
In terms of use of proceeds, we intend to use $100 million of the proceeds to pay down and support the refinancing of our existing corporate debt in a concurrent refinancing transaction.
We expect less restrictive covenants, eliminating amortization, and relative to existing corporate debt, extending the maturity with an expected tenure of six years on the Holdco notes.
Concurrent with the refinancing, we'll pay off our existing corporate debt per their respective terms.
The remaining $150 million in proceeds from the Holdco notes will be used to support our on book growth objectives through MSR purchases and funding a portion of the MAV investment.
We do expect the incremental capital in the operating company will allow us to improve the terms of our existing MSR financing which can create up to about $75 million in additional capital from our existing MSRs.
The proceeds from Oaktree will come in two tranches.
The first tranche is $175 million and that will come in concurrently with the closing of the corporate debt refinancing.
The remaining $75 million will come in concurrent with the closing of MAV.
Moving on to MAV.
As we announced in December, we formed a partnership joint venture with Oaktree Capital to launch an MSR asset vehicle.
This vehicle will purchase MSRs.
Oaktree will own 85% and Ocwen will own 15%.
You know, MAV expects to leverage up to $250 million in capital that will be contributed by Oaktree and Ocwen, respectively, based on our relative shares to purchase MSRs and this will be leveraged up roughly one for one with secured MSR financing.
So that gives us the capacity for up to about $60 billion in MSR UPB.
Now PHH will be the sole provider of originations, subservicing, and recaptured administrative services to MAV.
And Ocwen will also earn MSR investment returns on its capital contribution and from profit sharing on returns in MAV above 12%.
Now MAV is expected to close in the first half of 2021, subject to GSE and regulatory approvals.
In terms of benefits, MAV supports our servicing and subservicing growth objectives on a capital-efficient basis and will help generate increased cost efficiency through increased origination and servicing scale.
Moving on to Slide 8.
In terms of the financial impact of the Oaktree investment in Ocwen, we estimate that a -- on a combined basis, the Holdco notes and MAV can contribute up to $78 million in annualized pre-tax income from full deployment of the capital provided by these two structures.
We estimate full deployment of the proceeds can generate roughly $5 per share in incremental earnings on a fully diluted basis.
This translates to over a 65% increase above our potential baseline earnings per share range which assumes an after-tax ROE range of roughly 10% to 15% on about $414 million of equity.
Using a PE multiple range of some of our peers of roughly 4 times to 6 times forward earnings, the potential incremental value creation is roughly $20 to $30 per share.
This is a 7 times to 10 times multiple of the potential book value per share dilution, assuming the warrants are fully issued and the corresponding increase to our equity from the proceeds related to issuing the warrants.
The incremental investment capital will allow us to further expand our originations activities and expand our participation in the bulk purchase market.
We expect to source roughly up to $200 billion in incremental total volume over the next couple of years.
And again, it's estimated to source up to $200 billion in incremental volume over the next two years.
The total growth in volume will allow us to grow our total subservicing portfolio to roughly $300 billion by the end of 2022, assuming the NRZ subservicing contract does not renew.
So again, strong growth in the servicing portfolio resulting from the originations.
We believe it's a great time to invest in MSRs.
Pretax cash IRRs in our MSRs generated in December were about 12% before MSR financing, that translates to roughly 18% after MSR secured financing.
Now in addition, we'll continue to opportunistically evaluate M&A transactions to expand our originations and servicing capabilities which might provide enhanced returns versus MSR investments.
These estimates are based on the judgment of management and based on our current assumptions which may be subject to change based on market and industry conditions, among other things.
Look, the bottom line here is, we're really excited about our alliance with Oaktree and the opportunity it provides to enable a level of growth and earnings per share accretion and potential value creation that we could not achieve on a stand-alone basis.
Moving on to Slide 9, maybe a little bit about the fourth quarter.
So look, during 2020, we demonstrated exponential total volume growth, total cost improvement and built a scalable and efficient platform to support our future growth.
Adjusted pre-tax profitability was up roughly 15% in the fourth quarter over the third quarter despite declining origination margins.
Annualized adjusted pre-tax profitability has improved over $380 million over the second-quarter 2018 baseline for Ocwen and PHH combined.
Our multichannel origination platform continued to deliver really strong results.
Flow origination volume in the fourth quarter was up 49% over the third quarter and up over 7 times as compared to 2019.
So again, just really great performance by the originations team.
And as we talked about earlier, we're focused on accelerating our growth trajectory in 2021.
Yeah, we are focused on driving efficiency in our operating expenses.
And as a result of that efficiency and our continuous cost improvement, operating expenses are down 44% over the second-quarter 2018 baseline for Ocwen and PHH combined.
That's over a $400 million cost reduction.
So again, just great performance by the team in really rethinking and reimagining our business infrastructure.
You know, we're disappointed that settlement discussions with the CFPB did not resolve this matter and especially since we've resolved all state regulatory actions filed against Ocwen in 2017.
We engaged with the bureau in good faith throughout the course of mediation and numerous related discussions and took all actions in an attempt to reach a fair and reasonable resolution.
We increased our legal and regulatory accrual related to the CFPB matter by $13 million in the fourth quarter, resulting from our efforts to resolve the matter in mediation.
We remain steadfast in our belief that the CFPB's claims regarding Ocwen's past servicing practice are unsubstantiated and the bureau settlement demands do not reflect the merits of this case.
While we remain committed to attempting to resolve the matter prior to trial, our pending motion for summary judgment which was filed on June 5th, 2020, supports our position on this matter, and we expect to continually -- continue to vigorously defend ourselves going forward.
Look, it was a great quarter, the fourth quarter, a great year in 2020, and I could not be proud of the team of what they accomplished.
Yeah, moving to Slide 10.
Maybe a little bit about the originations platform.
We delivered a record total volume of $30 billion in the fourth quarter.
It translates to roughly an annualized run rate of about $60 billion from our flow channels and about $60 billion annualized from bulk.
Total volume for 2020 was $59 billion versus $26 billion last year, so we've doubled total volume.
Full-year flow and co-issue originations were up 8 times over last year.
Full-year bulk and subservicing adds were up over 48% as compared to last year.
Our correspondent and flow seller base increased about threefold since the fourth quarter of 2019.
You know, all of our channels delivered strong double-digit growth quarter over quarter.
As I mentioned before, cash yields and MSRs continued to be very strong, and our portfolio replenishment was exceptional.
In addition, in the fourth quarter, we were awarded multiple subservicing contracts with projected volume of $16 billion to $24 billion that we expect will board in the first and second quarter.
Now margins as well continued to contract in the fourth quarter.
We had expected that.
The average margins fell to about 56 basis points versus our expectation of 77 basis points for Q4.
This is really solely due to higher-than-expected third party volume.
Margin compression by each channel was actually slightly less than expected.
Again, here, great performance by our originations and capital markets teams and I believe we've got more room to grow.
We'll talk about that in a minute.
Turning to Slide 11.
Our servicing platform continued to deliver very strong performance in the fourth quarter.
Our servicing leadership team is doing a great job of driving continued improvement in efficiency and effectiveness and helping customers navigate through the crisis.
Our call center continued to outperform the MBA reported industry averages.
Our key claims metrics also continued to perform with nearly 100% effectiveness.
We continued to invest in technology to lower unit costs, improve performance for investors and enhance the customer experience.
Despite almost all of our people working remotely, we've continued our unparalleled track record of helping homeowners in need.
In 2020, we provided forbearance relief for over 180,000 consumers and we completed about 40 virtual borrower outreach events to reach consumers potentially impacted by the pandemic.
The strength of our originations have allowed us to grow our servicing portfolio slightly in the fourth quarter.
And we achieved roughly a 50-50 mix of owned servicing and subservicing.
Again, here, I'm really proud of how our servicing team has transformed their operation.
All our hard work over the last two years really positions us well for profitable growth, leveraging a scale -- a scalable and efficient platform for 2021.
Turning to Slide 12.
In 2021, looking ahead, the market, we expect the total originations will be down roughly about 17%, with much decline in the second half of the year.
You know Black Knight is reporting that there's still about 16 million to 17 million borrowers who are eligible for refinancing which should continue to drive the refi market in the near-term.
As well, the millennial generation is driving significant growth in the number of first-time potential homebuyers which should, long-term, also bode well for the purchase market.
Our reverse origination platform is positioned to support the financial needs of our growing senior population by tapping into an estimated $7.8 trillion of untapped home equity.
Our special servicing expertise and track record of creating non-foreclosure outcomes for consumers, you know, positions us to support the roughly 1.8 million homeowners who are still on forbearance who may need loss mitigation assistance.
We estimate that roughly 85% of these borrowers are delinquent and we further estimate that about 25% will need loss mitigation assistance.
We expect the increase in Ginnie Mae workouts as foreclosure alternatives will drive increased EBO, early buyout gain opportunities, in Ginnie Mae servicing, and the current low interest rate environment can create opportunities to drive increased realization of gains for executing call rights.
As most of you know, as rates rise, total industry volume will decline.
We also expect margins will contract and we've seen some of that this year.
However, rising rates can increase the value of our owned MSRs by extending duration and MSR amortization will slow as prepayments decrease.
The increase in MSR values, this rate rise will positively impact book value per share.
Turning to Slide 13.
You know, our focus for 2021 will be on executing five key business initiatives that we believe will help us capitalize on the opportunities that are available in the market ahead.
Those are accelerated growth, strengthen our recapture performance, improve our cost leadership position, maintain high-quality operational execution, and expand servicing revenue opportunities.
Yeah, from a regulatory perspective, we are monitoring and we'll continue to evaluate the impact that the Biden administration's key agenda items may have on our industry.
We'll also closely monitor -- be monitoring statements from the CFPB regarding any planned priorities or areas of focus.
And the President has already signed an Executive Order calling for various federal agencies to extend foreclosure and eviction moratoria, and the administration's enhanced stimulus plans could include additional protections with respect to forbearance and foreclosure, and eviction moratoria.
Any changes at the federal level will, obviously, be uniform across all competitors in the industry, and thus far, Ocwen alone, as well as, the industry has proven to be adaptable in a dynamic regulatory environment.
We expect the successful execution of our key initiatives will allow us to deliver positive GAAP earnings in 2021, with low double-digit to mid-teen after tax ROEs again by mid-2021, assuming no adverse changes in the market, industry or business conditions or legal and regulatory matters.
And June will take us through our road map for 2021 later.
And maybe I'd like to share a little bit more about each of these initiatives for 2021 on the next few pages.
Turning to Slide 14.
In 2021, our goal is to achieve over $100 billion in volume with the 40-60 mix of owned servicing and subservicing, respectively.
Our fourth-quarter run rate kind of puts us on track for those levels.
We focused on several actions to accelerate our growth trajectory by leveraging our multichannel platform.
Now we're targeting to grow our seller base again, over 450 sellers in 2021 to support our growth in correspondent and flow volume, as well as, performing and special subservicing opportunities.
We believe our broad portfolio of services, including subservicing, specialty servicing, MSR purchase through multiple delivery methods, provides a compelling value proposition.
We're also focused on expanding our product reach, so expanding our share in the Ginnie Mae market through correspondent, in the Ginnie Mae co-issue market and correspondent.
We're also working to introduce Jumbo and non-QM products, as well as, expanding our service to include best efforts and non-delegated delivery methods.
In subservicing, we're expanding our small balance commercial loan business.
That's begin to grow nicely for us.
And finally, MAV will allow us to expand our participation in the bulk market significantly which will help us create synthetic subservicing.
And finally, as I mentioned earlier, we continue to evaluate opportunities to enter higher-margin channels based on market conditions.
Now turning to Slide 15.
We continue to target achieving at least a 30% recapture rate for our recapture platform and we believe our recapture performance is only limited by our operating capacity to address available opportunities.
And our recapture team has consistently, over the last four or five quarters, grown our closings quarter over quarter and has marched up the recapture rate quite nicely, but we've still got more room to grow.
So we expect to increase staffing levels by over 40% through the course of 2021.
We're continuing to hire and train new team players in every position and intend to do so throughout the year.
We are focused on process and technology as well.
We're focused on helping new team players improve their productivity as they mature in their roles.
We're also driving continuous process improvement with our process improvement teams, leveraging our global workforce, and we're focused on implementing new technology to support expanding our capacity across the entire loan origination life cycle.
Yeah, moving to Slide 16.
We remain focused on driving productivity to improve our cost leadership position while maintaining high-quality operational execution.
We're targeting to reduce our servicing operating cost by roughly 2 basis points of UPB in this year and reducing corporate overhead expenses by roughly 1 basis points of UPB.
We're executing over 60 technology-enabled projects across the business to drive productivity, cost reduction, improved customer experience, and support growth.
We'll continue to focus on high-quality execution at our operations relative to comparative industry benchmarks to further improve our customer experience and create value for investors and clients.
And as we did in 2020, we stand ready to support consumers in need of forbearance relief and loss mitigation assistance as they come off forbearance.
On Slide 17, finally, we're focused here on several actions aimed to expand our servicing revenue opportunities.
We're preparing for a surge in loss mitigation related to expiring Ginnie Mae forbearance plans.
We expect this will also create a potential surge in early buyouts and modification related redelivery gains.
We're tracking roughly $300 million in RMBS call right opportunities.
We expect roughly $125 million will be eligible to call in 2021 and we'll continue to evaluate the variables that impact eligibility and economics of executing these calls throughout the year.
And finally, we continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our capabilities in both forward and reverse servicing.
This is our fifth consecutive quarter of positive adjusted pre-tax income.
Revenue decreased quarter over quarter, driven primarily by lower NRZ subservicing fees, resulting from UPB transfer and runoff.
We've been awarded multiple subservicing contracts with projected volume $16 billion to $24 billion and closed approximately $15 billion of MSR bulk purchases which should largely offset the lost revenue.
MSR adjustment decrease is driven by fair value calibration for higher one-off which reduced the fair value of MSRs in the third quarter.
We also recorded $3 million of higher gain during the quarter, largely driven by higher MSR purchase volumes.
Operating expense improvement is from leveraging technology and productivity actions as we continued to invest in our originations platform.
Adjusted pre-tax income is $15 million, $2 million higher than prior quarter, as favorable MSR valuation and lower expenses offset lower revenue.
Notables in the fourth quarter include a $13 million additional CFPB accrual and $4 million in other legal accruals.
We had higher income tax expense during the quarter which excludes tax benefit on fourth-quarter legal accruals which we expect to recognize when paid in 2021 and fourth-quarter period adjustment to the CARES Act benefit for higher pre-tax income than previously estimated for the year.
We reported a GAAP net loss of $7 million, $2 million improvement over prior quarter and after the $13 million of additional CFPB accrual I previously mentioned.
Our balanced business model is operating well.
Originations growth and profitability is replenishing the servicing portfolio and offsetting one-offs.
On the left side of the slide, you can see that our multichannel platform is fueling strong originations volume with growth up 164% quarter over quarter.
Servicing originated volume is up almost 4 times quarter over quarter, driving strong replenishment of 267%.
Adjusted pre-tax income was $35 million, $2 million lower than the prior quarter as higher volume was offset by expected margin normalization and $5 million of investment in our platform.
On the right side of the slide, our servicing segment is demonstrating strong performance through the refinance cycle, delivering improved results quarter over quarter.
UPB runoff is being replenished through newly originated servicing and subservicing despite a $16 billion transfer of the NRZ portfolio previously terminated in 2020.
We have a strong subservicing pipeline with our top 15 prospects at approximately $85 billion, with additional opportunities from MAV.
We continue to optimize our cost structure through rigorous process redesign and increased automation, driving improved efficiency.
Our total exposure to loans on forbearance continues to diminish and tracks favorable to our forecast.
You can see on the left that both the total number of forbearance plans and the forbearance plans where we have ultimate responsibility to advance continue to decline.
As the chart reflects, there's a significant difference between total forbearance plans and the amount where we have ultimate responsibility to advance.
This is a function and a benefit from our strategy to maintain a mix of owned servicing and subservicing.
On the upper right chart, you can see that our owned servicing portfolio is performing favorable to other nonbank servicers in terms of percent of loans on forbearance.
We are seeing roughly 53% of our borrowers on maturing forbearance plans reinstate and 40% extend.
Roughly 4% have progressed to loss mitigation and we are awaiting decision for direction from the borrower on about 3% of plans that have matured.
Our expectation is roughly 75% of borrowers on forbearance will reinstate and less than 25% will need some form of loss assistance.
We ended the quarter with $285 million in liquidity.
We have made significant investments in bulk MSR market opportunities and originations during the quarter.
We invested $190 million in cash before financing to fund $25 billion of MSR originations, $18 billion higher than the prior quarter, largely driven by opportunistic bulk MSR acquisitions.
Our originations generated strong cash-on-cash unlevered yields of approximately 12% across all channels.
Servicing advances continue to track favorably and actual advances were 29% lower than forecast.
Lower advance originations were largely driven by higher prepayments and more forbearance plans performing.
We're focused on our five operating objectives, as highlighted by Glen earlier to achieve our profitability goals.
We expect to generate positive GAAP earnings in 2021 with low- to mid-teen after-tax ROE by mid-2021.
This page is a road map to achieving these results broken down by operating objectives in originations, servicing, and corporate segments.
I won't go through the details on the call here today, but please let me know if you'd like to review at another time as we have to go through the details.
You know, wrap up, let's turn to Page 24.
As I said at the onset, I'm just energized about the opportunities and our potential for 2021 and beyond.
We've radically transformed Ocwen.
It's a better balanced, diversified mortgage originator and servicer.
Our strategic alliance with Oaktree can provide almost $0.5 billion of incremental capital to enable a level of growth, earnings per share accretion, and potential value creation that we could just not achieve on a stand-alone basis.
We're stronger, more efficient, and better aligned to future market opportunities as a result of all the hard work of the Ocwen global team.
We're delivering record growth in originations and we continue to reshape and diversify our servicing portfolio.
As we look to the opportunities ahead, we believe we're fairly well-positioned to capitalize on the potential future growth opportunities in multiple market segments.
You know in 2021, we're focused on executing five straightforward objectives to drive improved value for shareholders and achieve our goal of low double-digit to mid-teen after-tax return on equities by mid-2021.
And you know, none of this would be possible without all the hard work of our global Ocwen team.

Ocwen Financial Corporation (Ocwen) announced fourth quarter 2020 adjusted pre-tax income of $15 million.
Ocwen's fourth quarter 2020 results reflect an increase of $2 million compared to the third quarter 2020 adjusted pre-tax income of $13 million.
The improvement in adjusted pre-tax income is primarily driven by higher MSR yields and lower operating expenses.
Ocwen's fourth quarter 2020 adjusted pre-tax income was primarily driven by higher MSR yields, lower operating expenses and a decrease in the MSR fair value adjustment.
These favorable items were partially offset by lower NRZ subservicing fees and higher legal accruals.

Ocwen's fourth quarter 2020 adjusted pre-tax income was $15 million, an increase of $2 million from the third quarter 2020 adjusted pre-tax income of $13 million.
The improvement in adjusted pre-tax income is primarily driven by higher MSR yields and lower operating expenses.
The higher MSR yields were driven by higher cash-on-cash yields and lower MSR amortization, partially offset by lower MSR purchase volume.
The lower operating expenses were primarily driven by continued productivity improvements in the servicing business, partially offset by increased investment in the originations business.
The decrease in the MSR fair value adjustment was primarily driven by higher one-off MSR prepayments, partially offset by lower MSR purchase volume.
The decrease in NRZ subservicing fees was primarily driven by the transfer of $16 billion in UPB to NRZ in the second quarter 2020.
The increase in legal accruals was primarily driven by a $13 million increase in the CFPB legal accrual.

10,"So it was.com Kessel Stelling, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will begin the call.
He will be followed by Jamie Gregory, Chief Financial Officer and Kevin Blair, President and Chief Operating Officer for more detailed information.
We ask that you limit yourselves to two questions.
During the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures related to the company's performance.
And now here's Kessel Stelling.
We have two main stories today and probably many more.
One is of our strong core operating performance for the first quarter pre and post coronavirus arrival.
The other equally important story is the strength and resilience of our company, which is again proven our ability to innovate to execute quickly and effectively manage day-to-day operations while also shifting priorities and resources to meet the emerging needs.
From the very beginning of this COVID-19 healthcare crisis, the decisions and actions taken by our team have been guided by two principles, doing what's best for the physical and financial well-being of our team members and doing what's best for our customers.
With those principles in mind, in March, our branches were converted to drive through and appointment only and we implemented aggressive cleaning, sanitizing, hygiene protocols at all of our company facilities.
More than 80% of 5,400 team members are now working from home and our IT team did a fabulous job quickly repositioning our workforce.
We've offered additional paid-time off the team members who are sick, who are quarantining or dealing with child care or other related family hardships and we're offering bonus payments to our hourly team members required to work on site to serve our customers.
To help our customers through this period of financial stress, we're waiting NSF and monthly service fees and offering payment the permit and other loan relief as appropriate.
Although social distancing is more or less eliminated the in-person hands on approach we usually take toward community service, we're doing everything we can to support needs across our footprint, including matching contributions to the American Red Cross, providing financial support for feeding America and funding meals for first responders and front-line healthcare providers.
I am especially proud of the effort our team has made to deliver paycheck protection program loans to our customers.
Since the launch of P3 on April 3, our team has processed, approved and funded more than $2 billion in loans for 8,300 customers.
We're continuing to process submissions in our pipeline, preparing to find as many as possible with the additional appropriations made available this week.
Kevin Blair will talk more about the key aspects of our COVID-19 response later in his remarks.
Before I cover highlights for the first quarter, I want to talk about our confidence in our ability to manage through this current crisis and to emerge from it in even stronger position.
Since the last crisis, our company has continually taken steps to prepare for an adverse economic environment including efforts to strengthen management in the key risk areas of capital credit and liquidity.
We routinely deploy stress testing and sensitivity analyzes to inform business decisions and we believe we're well positioned to sustain an economic downturn such as we're facing today.
On capital, our internal stress testing process gives us confidence in our ability to maintain strong capital ratios and stressed economic environments and our liquidity position remains strong.
We're also assessing and reprioritizing strategic initiatives under our Synovus forward program Kevin Blair is going to share more details later in the call on steps we're taking to ensure we're addressing the shorter term imperatives while also focusing on the right initiatives for strengthening our company long-term.
I'll briefly walk through highlights of the quarter on slide four.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.21 compared to $0.98 a year ago.
This year-over-year decline was driven by a 225 basis point reduction in the Fed funds rate, the schedule loss of loan accretion from acquired loans and a significant increase to the allowance that accounts for the anticipated impact of COVID-19 under the CECL framework.
We were very pleased with the fundamentals of our core performance including period end loan growth of $1.1 billion, deposit growth of $1.4 billion and core transaction deposit growth of more than $600 million.
Core net interest income, which excludes purchase accounting adjustments was flat for the quarter.
However, the core net interest margin declined 5 basis points from the prior quarter, slightly more than our original expectations due to the more significant reduction in interest rates.
Adjusted non-interest revenue of $99 million grew $7 million from fourth quarter benefiting from significant activity in mortgage, capital markets and fiduciary businesses.
This was despite lower seasonal core banking fees and increased fee waivers as part of our effort to serve clients during this COVID-19 disruption.
Adjusted non-interest expense totaled $271 million for the quarter, up $6 million versus the previous quarter, largely due to the $5 million increase in seasonal payroll taxes that were referenced during our fourth quarter earnings call.
We also had an incremental $1 million in expenses associated with COVID related bonus payments for certain front line team members.
Provision for credit losses was $159 million and resulted in an allowance for credit losses ratio of 1.39%.
These metrics incorporate the impact from COVID and the first quarter of CECL.
Before I get started walking through the quarterly performance.
I'd like to highlight that we have withdrawn our 2020 guidance.
We will give some near term indications of financial performance on key metrics throughout my commentary and we are committed to reestablishing longer-term targets when the economy stabilizes.
We discussed our increased productivity a bit on the fourth quarter call and it continue on to the first quarter with $3.1 billion in total loan production.
Our Wholesale Banking team one boarded 155 new customers during the quarter, which represented $1 billion in new loans.
In March, we saw $300 million increase in line utilization.
C&I line utilization plateaued at 50% in March as some customers increased draw-out of an abundance of caution related to the economic situation.
We are confident in the credit quality of our growth this quarter as we remain disciplined in our underwriting.
In the second quarter, we expect loans from the paycheck protection program to serve as the primary engine for loan growth as additional pipelines have declined.
Rate cuts in March led to loan yields of 4.6% excluding purchase accounting a decline of 15 basis points from the prior quarter.
The full quarter impact of these March costs will have a greater impact on the average loan yields in the second quarter.
On adjusted for hedges, approximately 50% of our loans have a floating rate.
As previously discussed, we have a hedging program in place to help mitigate the impact of changes in short-term rates on our floating rate loan portfolio.
At quarter end, we had $2.8 billion in receipt fixed swaps associated with these hedges with an average rate of 1.4% versus one month LIBOR.
Slide six shows deposit growth of $1.4 billion, which included a continue to increases in core transaction deposits of $623 million.
In the first quarter, we took advantage of reduced pricing on wholesale broker deposits to increased balances and replace higher call single service deposits.
We will continue to monitor these markets for opportunities and while it remains a dynamic deposit environment and remain focused on growing our core deposit base and maintaining a prudent liquidity profile.
In terms of overall deposit pricing, we've certainly seen a response to the recent FOMC actions.
And as you can see our total interest-bearing cost in March were approximately 30 basis points lower than the average from the prior quarter.
In this easing cycle, the FOMC cut their target rate by 225 basis points and our general expectation is for cycle betas to end in the low to mid 30s as deposits repriced throughout the year.
As you can see on slide seven, net interest income of $373 million declined $26 million from the prior quarter.
The majority of that decline or $25 million was attributable to the expected decline in purchase accounting adjustments.
The core net interest margin, which excludes PAA decreased 5 basis points from the prior quarter to 3.35%.
As we look into the second quarter, we expect net interest income to remain relatively flat as a result of significant loan growth associated with P3.
However, this growth along with the depressed rate environment and an elevated cash position is expected to weigh on our net interest margin.
Excluding those impacts, we reiterate that we expect the margin to decline 4 basis points to 5 basis points per 25 basis point decrease.
We expect the majority of the impact from March rate cuts to be realized in the second quarter.
On slide eight, you will see that we have had continued success in fee revenue generation, which increased to $99 million adjusted.
That's an increase of $7 million from the prior quarter and up $21 million or 27% versus the prior year.
In the first quarter, we continue to have diversified strength in our fee revenue business.
Mortgage revenue driven by high production levels and elevated secondary gain on sale margins increased $3 million.
Capital markets volumes were higher by $2 million as our commercial clients locked in lower rates on their borrowings and income from brokerage grew $1 million, driven by increase in contributions of new hires in 2019 and higher transaction revenue from elevated market volatility.
These increases more than offset reductions in areas such as service charges on deposit accounts, primarily due to a decline in retail NSF fees.
However, COVID is already impacting customer behavior including significant declines in capital markets activity, lower debit and credit card transaction volumes and overall business disruption for commercial clients.
This disruption will likely result in fee revenue declining 15% to 25% in the second quarter from our recent run rate of approximately $90 million.
We would expect an increase in non-interest revenues as the economy stabilizes.
Moving to slide nine.
In the first quarter, non-interest expense was $276 million for $271 million adjusted.
Adjusted expenses increased $6 million from the prior quarter, generally in line with our prior guidance.
With the increased level of COVID related expenses, which we currently estimate of $5 million to $6 million in the second quarter we expect adjusted expenses to remain relatively stable quarter-on-quarter before declining in the second half of the year.
As Kevin will discuss in a moment, we remain confident that our efforts over the past six months to identify ways to improve our operating efficiency will result in positive operating leverage over the long-term.
We are tailoring the timing of our Synovus forward initiatives to ensure they do not distract from our focus on team members customers and communities.
This doesn't change our commitment to our strategy, it simply adjust the timing.
Slide 10 shows our credit quality metrics as well as the summary of our provision for credit losses and allowance.
Net charge-offs at 21 basis points remain within prior guidance.
The NPL ratio did increase from the prior quarter to 41 basis points and this is up 1 basis point from the prior year.
Additionally, past-dues return to the low end of the recent range at 22 basis points.
While we expect to experience stress in the portfolio as we progressed in the current economic environment, it is important to note that we are entering this downturn well positioned from a credit quality standpoint with NPAs, NPLs, past dues and charge-offs at or near lows for this economic cycle.
Provision for credit losses and allowance for the quarter were impacted by the adoption of CECL on January 1 which generally results in higher provision for credit losses compared to the incurred loss.
As you can see on slide 11, the day one reserve increase was $110 million or 39%.
We did a lag the five-year transition period for regulatory capital treatment.
Our 10-K reference the two-year reasonable and supportable period used in CECL estimate, but it was a more appropriate to reduce that for one-year horizon during this period of heightened economic uncertainty, a one-year reversion to the mean follows the reasonable and formal period.
The deterioration in the economic environment since January 1 due to the current healthcare crisis resulted in a higher allowance for credit losses ratio as of March 31st, then was modeled in the day one seasonal implementation and is currently at 1.39%.
Our modeling process incorporates quantitative and qualitative considerations that are used to inform CECL estimates.
The internally developed economic forecasts used to determine the allowance for credit losses as of March 31 was approved on March 20.
At the time, the approved forecast line with rating agency and Wall Street economic forecast between that approval date and quarter-end, we saw further deterioration in the economic outlook, which resulted in the need for a qualitative overlay to our allowance for credit losses.
The qualitative overlay of $37 million at 10 basis points to the allowance for credit losses and better aligns the total allowance with the economic indicators and forecast at the end of the first quarter.
Significant economic uncertainty remains as a result of the continuing healthcare crisis and the ultimate impact of government stimulus efforts.
If our economic outlook on June 30 resembles these more recent forecast, we would expect to see further increase in the allowance for credit losses.
Capital ratios on slide 12 include the impact of CECL and incorporate applicable regulatory transition period.
As we've shared in the past, our target capital ratios were determined through our routine internal capital adequacy assessment process and include the capital optimization efforts completed in 2019.
These capital ratios give us comfort that even in a severely adverse scenario we have a sufficient buffer to withstand the losses and our main well capital.
In the first quarter, our CET1 ratio declined 8.72% largely due to the increase in risk-weighted assets, which accounted for a reduction of 25 basis points.
Our continued strength and PPNR generated 39 basis points of capital, which more than offset the 21 basis point impact of CECL related allowance build.
As a result of CECL, we anticipate capital ratio degradation earlier in a recessionary environment than under prior accounting guidance.
However, it is that allowance, which will provide a significant buffer to absorb any realized losses later in the cycle and affords us the ability to return to our capital targets over-time.
Currently, the allowance bill was reflected in the total risk-based capital ratio, which increased 6 basis points from the prior quarter to 12.31%.
Based on the same framework that was established and utilized for stress testing under the Dodd-Frank Act, we continue to leverage our internal capital management processes.
These processes coupled with our risk appetite framework provide a road map and outlines capital preservation strategies in the event we see a more protracted period of economic weakness.
As we navigate through this recession, we will be very diligent in how we deploy our balance sheet with a clear prioritization toward core customer relationships.
These processes also govern how we consider share repurchases in our common equity dividend.
Through this process, we determined to suspend our previously approved share repurchase program.
We continually evaluate our approach to common equity dividends in our capital planning process, which is guided by our assessment of capital adequacy as well as our projection of sustainable long-term earnings.
We believe a change in the common dividend is not warranted at this time.
As discussed, we remain confident in our capital adequacy and we continuously assess our long-term earnings outlook.
Liquidity management has always been a priority at Synovus and we continue to improve our liquidity profile.
In the first quarter, we issued $400 million of bank debt at very attractive levels and we increased our collateral of the Federal Home Loan Bank by approximately $2 billion.
As shown on slide 13, you can see that we have approximately $14 billion in readily available balance sheet liquidity.
While we expect loan balances excluding P3 loans to remain fairly flat over the near term, we do anticipate considerable second quarter growth associated with our P3 lending effort.
To best manage our risk and to maintain our existing funding sources for other customer need.
we anticipate using the Federal Reserve's P3 lending facility to support funding for at least a portion of these loans.
We believe that this is the most effective way to manage our overall liquidity position and to mitigate the associated impact on our capital ratios.
Kevin will now share a deeper dive on credit portfolios most impacted by COVID, some details about our responses to this crisis and provide an update on Synovus forward.
Before I go into deeper detail on several industries where the COVID-19 crisis is currently having a greater impact on business operations, this seems like an appropriate time to take a deeper dive into the composition and the quality of our loan portfolio by category as well as the significance of the diversification and derisking benefits that have been realized since the last financial crisis.
The chart on the slide shows the key components of each of our three portfolio categories with the table on the bottom right showing the shift in the composition from 2009.
Our C&I book totaled $17.7 billion and is primarily comprised of general middle market and commercial banking clients across a diverse set of industries.
Within C&I, the specialty divisions such as senior housing and premium finance comprised about 14% of total loans and have been a significant contributor to our growth story while also possessing some of the best credit metrics over the last several years.
The overall portfolio is well diversified by industry and geography and is extremely granular with almost 35,000 loans with an average original loan balance of approximately $770,000.
The CRE portfolio is $10.7 billion and 86% of the book is comprised of income producing properties with multifamily office, shopping center and hotel being the largest property types within the portfolio.
We do adhere to a disciplined concentration management philosophy thus our largest CRE loan is less than $50 million with an average loan size of approximately $13 million.
This portfolio is diverse both from a geographic and property type standpoint with strong loan to value and debt service coverage levels.
As a result, this portfolio has continued to perform well and as it relates to net charge-offs, the CRE book is in a net recovery position over the last five quarters.
The consumer book is $10 billion, almost three quarters of the consumer portfolio is in mortgage and HELOC categories with the remainder in lending partnerships, credit cards and other consumer.
You can see by the credit score and loan to value statistics that this portfolio is super-prime and remains very healthy.
Under the existing economic conditions, we expect our consumer portfolio to decline in the near term as we decreased our appetite for unsecured lending and third party partnership purchases.
The last point I want to cover on this slide is the substantial improvement that we've made to the diversification and derisking of the entire loan portfolio.
From 2009 until first quarter of 2020 we have significantly reduced our exposure to one-to-four family residential land and investment properties as well as CRE in aggregate.
By simply utilizing historical loss rates, the remix of our portfolio alone would result in a 50% reduction in losses.
Combined with the improvements in underwriting and portfolio management, we would expect losses to decline even further when evaluating the impact of the severely adverse scenario.
Moving to slide 15.
While our entire loan portfolio is continuously assessed, we have introduced enhanced monitoring for the segments noted on slide 15.
These segments totaling $4.6 billion had been identified as having a more direct and immediate impact from the COVID-19 crisis.
We are continuously working with our customers to evaluate how the current economic conditions are impacting their business operations and ultimately their cash burn rate.
We are leveraging payment deferments as well as the CARES Act stimulus programs to help weather short-term financial effects.
Solid underwriting and strong credit performance coupled with stronger balance sheets that have been built during our extended expansionary period give us confidence that these portfolios enter this downturn in the best possible position.
In the appendix on slides 27 through 29 you will find more detail around each of these portfolios, but I will touch on a few of them now.
Our hotel book is over 85% franchised and primarily contains non-resort properties, more than 90% of our hotels are rated upper mid scale or above.
This portfolio has strong credit metrics with an average loan to value of 54% and debt service coverage ratios of 1.9 times.
We have about $1 billion of shopping center exposure to centers that aren't grocery pharmacy or discount store-anchored.
Based on our southeastern footprint, these locations are situated markets that have continue to see good population and household income growth, which has created growth and stability for these businesses.
As such, these portfolios continue to perform well from a credit quality standpoint.
The restaurant book is $800 million with 56% of the book in limited service restaurants and 40% in full service.
Over 60% of our restaurants are franchises and have an average loan size at origination of roughly $1.5 million.
The next 2 industries are non-essential retail trade and arts entertainment and recreation, combining for $1.2 billion in outstandings.
Both of these portfolios have performed well pre-crisis and are also very granular with average loan sizes at origination of $1.8 million and $1.2 million respectively.
Lastly, I will mention are relatively small exposure to oil-related industries at less than 1% of total loans.
Given our five state footprint, oil is not a prevalent industry, particularly as it relates to exploration and production.
Most of our exposures and transportation operations and support related to the industry.
This portfolio has exhibited strong credit performance, but given the current state of the oil industry, we are more closely monitoring our exposure.
Our bankers and credit team members continue to work with and provide financial advice and consultation to our customers and ensure we are providing the necessary support to mitigate the short-term disruption and cash flows.
As with our entire credit portfolio, each of these portfolios has exhibited strong performance over the trailing quarters and years and was as well positioned as could be expected coming into the current environment.
The duration of the downturn will obviously determine the impact on these businesses and how quickly these industries will return to more normalized cash flow levels.
Despite rolling out our Synovus forward playbook in March, we quickly reconfigured our efforts to focus on our COVID response starting with the safety and well-being of our team members who are vitally important to support our customers as well as the communities we serve.
We effectively exercised our business continuity plan, which enables our employees to work remotely while continuing to provide customer facing roles in our branches and call centers to meet the needs of our customers.
And quite frankly, that was our other primary focus, the safety and continued service of our customers.
Although we continue to practice social distancing, we are here to serve our customers and continue to provide advice and new solutions to help them navigate the changing business climate and support their business operations.
In fact, during the first quarter, we implemented over 6,000 new services in our Treasury & Payment Solutions area, which represented a 320% increase over the first quarter of 2019.
This is another proof point of our continued commitment to serve our customers and our ability to do so in a difficult climate.
And despite the crisis, our bankers continue to call on and on-board new prospects as our relationship-based approach is serving as a key differentiator in this trying environment.
We are going to deploy our capital in areas where we receive optimal returns and while this business approach may produce lower loan growth in aggregate, we will continue to focus on acquiring new full service relationships and deepening our current relationships with new opportunities.
As we have mentioned, we've also taken a proactive approach to providing relief to our customers when needed from waving fees to increasing ATM and mobile deposit limits to granting deferments on loan payments.
Our loan deferment program is constructed to allow smaller loans upon request to receive a short-term 90-day deferral of interest and principal to the maturity date of the loan.
For larger loans, we have initiated a credit driven approach to review the specific circumstances of each request, annualized cash burn and obtain updated financial information while determining the need for the deferment.
To-date, our percentage of total deferrals is around 13% of the overall portfolio with those industries more directly impacted by COVID-19 carrying higher percentages.
We also have closely monitored all of the stimulus actions and programs made available by the CARES Act.
Obviously the paycheck protection program has had the greatest impact on our customers to this point.
We began the P3 process on March 28 with an online expression of interest portal.
We began taking applications on April 3rd, the day the program went live.
As Kessel mentioned earlier, as of today, we have secured funding for over 8,000 customers for approximately $2 billion.
As I close, let me transition to the future at Synovus Forward.
As we shared during an investor conference in March, Synovus Forward is our newly formed program that was built to generate an incremental $100 million of pre-tax income in the coming years and to lead to top quartile performance among mid cap banks in terms of profitability and efficiency.
During the development of this program, we evaluated over 20 unique and distinct initiatives that included a combination of expense and revenue opportunities.
We are confirming today that the incremental opportunity is still very achievable.
However, many of the benefits have been delayed due to the focus on the current crisis.
Many of the expense and revenue initiatives that were planned for the first half of 2020 will be recast into the second half of the year or in early 2021.
While we have had to delay some initiatives, we are also accelerating actions in others.
This includes increasing the efficiencies gained from the third-party spend initiatives, accelerating the development of digital and analytical capabilities to drive growth and manage risk and leveraging our remote environment to aggressively think about our physical distribution and locations.
We have also continue to invest in technology and more specifically, My Synovus, our consumer digital portal.
In March, we deployed major updates to enhance the bill-pay and transfer experiences of our customers.
And as we made improvements, we've seen higher levels of enrollment and utilization while seeing our overall operating increase and it's important to note that the current crisis is creating opportunities to add new initiatives to the portfolio and resize current initiatives that we had planned.
The Synovus Forward portfolio is not rigid it and will continue to evolve we are committed to delivering and growing the value as we address new economic and customer behavior realities.
There is much work ahead of us and we understand the need to balance both short term and long-term priorities.
The end state benefits, their timing and sizing may continue to evolve in this fluid environment.
And for a brief update on the weeks activities just wanted to share that on Wednesday, we hosted our first online only virtual shareholder meeting.
Among other actions our shareholders overwhelmingly approved the elimination of our 10 -1 voting structure and super majority voting requirements.
These changes reflect our Board's continuing commitment to best-in-class corporate governance.

He will be followed by Jamie Gregory, Chief Financial Officer and Kevin Blair, President and Chief Operating Officer for more detailed information.
We ask that you limit yourselves to two questions.
During the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures related to the company's performance.
And now here's Kessel Stelling.
We have two main stories today and probably many more.
One is of our strong core operating performance for the first quarter pre and post coronavirus arrival.
The other equally important story is the strength and resilience of our company, which is again proven our ability to innovate to execute quickly and effectively manage day-to-day operations while also shifting priorities and resources to meet the emerging needs.
From the very beginning of this COVID-19 healthcare crisis, the decisions and actions taken by our team have been guided by two principles, doing what's best for the physical and financial well-being of our team members and doing what's best for our customers.
With those principles in mind, in March, our branches were converted to drive through and appointment only and we implemented aggressive cleaning, sanitizing, hygiene protocols at all of our company facilities.
More than 80% of 5,400 team members are now working from home and our IT team did a fabulous job quickly repositioning our workforce.
We've offered additional paid-time off the team members who are sick, who are quarantining or dealing with child care or other related family hardships and we're offering bonus payments to our hourly team members required to work on site to serve our customers.
To help our customers through this period of financial stress, we're waiting NSF and monthly service fees and offering payment the permit and other loan relief as appropriate.
Although social distancing is more or less eliminated the in-person hands on approach we usually take toward community service, we're doing everything we can to support needs across our footprint, including matching contributions to the American Red Cross, providing financial support for feeding America and funding meals for first responders and front-line healthcare providers.
I am especially proud of the effort our team has made to deliver paycheck protection program loans to our customers.
Since the launch of P3 on April 3, our team has processed, approved and funded more than $2 billion in loans for 8,300 customers.
We're continuing to process submissions in our pipeline, preparing to find as many as possible with the additional appropriations made available this week.
Kevin Blair will talk more about the key aspects of our COVID-19 response later in his remarks.
Before I cover highlights for the first quarter, I want to talk about our confidence in our ability to manage through this current crisis and to emerge from it in even stronger position.
Since the last crisis, our company has continually taken steps to prepare for an adverse economic environment including efforts to strengthen management in the key risk areas of capital credit and liquidity.
We routinely deploy stress testing and sensitivity analyzes to inform business decisions and we believe we're well positioned to sustain an economic downturn such as we're facing today.
On capital, our internal stress testing process gives us confidence in our ability to maintain strong capital ratios and stressed economic environments and our liquidity position remains strong.
We're also assessing and reprioritizing strategic initiatives under our Synovus forward program Kevin Blair is going to share more details later in the call on steps we're taking to ensure we're addressing the shorter term imperatives while also focusing on the right initiatives for strengthening our company long-term.
I'll briefly walk through highlights of the quarter on slide four.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.21 compared to $0.98 a year ago.
This year-over-year decline was driven by a 225 basis point reduction in the Fed funds rate, the schedule loss of loan accretion from acquired loans and a significant increase to the allowance that accounts for the anticipated impact of COVID-19 under the CECL framework.
We were very pleased with the fundamentals of our core performance including period end loan growth of $1.1 billion, deposit growth of $1.4 billion and core transaction deposit growth of more than $600 million.
Core net interest income, which excludes purchase accounting adjustments was flat for the quarter.
However, the core net interest margin declined 5 basis points from the prior quarter, slightly more than our original expectations due to the more significant reduction in interest rates.
Adjusted non-interest revenue of $99 million grew $7 million from fourth quarter benefiting from significant activity in mortgage, capital markets and fiduciary businesses.
This was despite lower seasonal core banking fees and increased fee waivers as part of our effort to serve clients during this COVID-19 disruption.
Adjusted non-interest expense totaled $271 million for the quarter, up $6 million versus the previous quarter, largely due to the $5 million increase in seasonal payroll taxes that were referenced during our fourth quarter earnings call.
We also had an incremental $1 million in expenses associated with COVID related bonus payments for certain front line team members.
Provision for credit losses was $159 million and resulted in an allowance for credit losses ratio of 1.39%.
These metrics incorporate the impact from COVID and the first quarter of CECL.
Before I get started walking through the quarterly performance.
I'd like to highlight that we have withdrawn our 2020 guidance.
We will give some near term indications of financial performance on key metrics throughout my commentary and we are committed to reestablishing longer-term targets when the economy stabilizes.
We discussed our increased productivity a bit on the fourth quarter call and it continue on to the first quarter with $3.1 billion in total loan production.
Our Wholesale Banking team one boarded 155 new customers during the quarter, which represented $1 billion in new loans.
In March, we saw $300 million increase in line utilization.
C&I line utilization plateaued at 50% in March as some customers increased draw-out of an abundance of caution related to the economic situation.
We are confident in the credit quality of our growth this quarter as we remain disciplined in our underwriting.
In the second quarter, we expect loans from the paycheck protection program to serve as the primary engine for loan growth as additional pipelines have declined.
Rate cuts in March led to loan yields of 4.6% excluding purchase accounting a decline of 15 basis points from the prior quarter.
The full quarter impact of these March costs will have a greater impact on the average loan yields in the second quarter.
On adjusted for hedges, approximately 50% of our loans have a floating rate.
As previously discussed, we have a hedging program in place to help mitigate the impact of changes in short-term rates on our floating rate loan portfolio.
At quarter end, we had $2.8 billion in receipt fixed swaps associated with these hedges with an average rate of 1.4% versus one month LIBOR.
Slide six shows deposit growth of $1.4 billion, which included a continue to increases in core transaction deposits of $623 million.
In the first quarter, we took advantage of reduced pricing on wholesale broker deposits to increased balances and replace higher call single service deposits.
We will continue to monitor these markets for opportunities and while it remains a dynamic deposit environment and remain focused on growing our core deposit base and maintaining a prudent liquidity profile.
In terms of overall deposit pricing, we've certainly seen a response to the recent FOMC actions.
And as you can see our total interest-bearing cost in March were approximately 30 basis points lower than the average from the prior quarter.
In this easing cycle, the FOMC cut their target rate by 225 basis points and our general expectation is for cycle betas to end in the low to mid 30s as deposits repriced throughout the year.
As you can see on slide seven, net interest income of $373 million declined $26 million from the prior quarter.
The majority of that decline or $25 million was attributable to the expected decline in purchase accounting adjustments.
The core net interest margin, which excludes PAA decreased 5 basis points from the prior quarter to 3.35%.
As we look into the second quarter, we expect net interest income to remain relatively flat as a result of significant loan growth associated with P3.
However, this growth along with the depressed rate environment and an elevated cash position is expected to weigh on our net interest margin.
Excluding those impacts, we reiterate that we expect the margin to decline 4 basis points to 5 basis points per 25 basis point decrease.
We expect the majority of the impact from March rate cuts to be realized in the second quarter.
On slide eight, you will see that we have had continued success in fee revenue generation, which increased to $99 million adjusted.
That's an increase of $7 million from the prior quarter and up $21 million or 27% versus the prior year.
In the first quarter, we continue to have diversified strength in our fee revenue business.
Mortgage revenue driven by high production levels and elevated secondary gain on sale margins increased $3 million.
Capital markets volumes were higher by $2 million as our commercial clients locked in lower rates on their borrowings and income from brokerage grew $1 million, driven by increase in contributions of new hires in 2019 and higher transaction revenue from elevated market volatility.
These increases more than offset reductions in areas such as service charges on deposit accounts, primarily due to a decline in retail NSF fees.
However, COVID is already impacting customer behavior including significant declines in capital markets activity, lower debit and credit card transaction volumes and overall business disruption for commercial clients.
This disruption will likely result in fee revenue declining 15% to 25% in the second quarter from our recent run rate of approximately $90 million.
We would expect an increase in non-interest revenues as the economy stabilizes.
Moving to slide nine.
In the first quarter, non-interest expense was $276 million for $271 million adjusted.
Adjusted expenses increased $6 million from the prior quarter, generally in line with our prior guidance.
With the increased level of COVID related expenses, which we currently estimate of $5 million to $6 million in the second quarter we expect adjusted expenses to remain relatively stable quarter-on-quarter before declining in the second half of the year.
As Kevin will discuss in a moment, we remain confident that our efforts over the past six months to identify ways to improve our operating efficiency will result in positive operating leverage over the long-term.
We are tailoring the timing of our Synovus forward initiatives to ensure they do not distract from our focus on team members customers and communities.
This doesn't change our commitment to our strategy, it simply adjust the timing.
Slide 10 shows our credit quality metrics as well as the summary of our provision for credit losses and allowance.
Net charge-offs at 21 basis points remain within prior guidance.
The NPL ratio did increase from the prior quarter to 41 basis points and this is up 1 basis point from the prior year.
Additionally, past-dues return to the low end of the recent range at 22 basis points.
While we expect to experience stress in the portfolio as we progressed in the current economic environment, it is important to note that we are entering this downturn well positioned from a credit quality standpoint with NPAs, NPLs, past dues and charge-offs at or near lows for this economic cycle.
Provision for credit losses and allowance for the quarter were impacted by the adoption of CECL on January 1 which generally results in higher provision for credit losses compared to the incurred loss.
As you can see on slide 11, the day one reserve increase was $110 million or 39%.
We did a lag the five-year transition period for regulatory capital treatment.
Our 10-K reference the two-year reasonable and supportable period used in CECL estimate, but it was a more appropriate to reduce that for one-year horizon during this period of heightened economic uncertainty, a one-year reversion to the mean follows the reasonable and formal period.
The deterioration in the economic environment since January 1 due to the current healthcare crisis resulted in a higher allowance for credit losses ratio as of March 31st, then was modeled in the day one seasonal implementation and is currently at 1.39%.
Our modeling process incorporates quantitative and qualitative considerations that are used to inform CECL estimates.
The internally developed economic forecasts used to determine the allowance for credit losses as of March 31 was approved on March 20.
At the time, the approved forecast line with rating agency and Wall Street economic forecast between that approval date and quarter-end, we saw further deterioration in the economic outlook, which resulted in the need for a qualitative overlay to our allowance for credit losses.
The qualitative overlay of $37 million at 10 basis points to the allowance for credit losses and better aligns the total allowance with the economic indicators and forecast at the end of the first quarter.
Significant economic uncertainty remains as a result of the continuing healthcare crisis and the ultimate impact of government stimulus efforts.
If our economic outlook on June 30 resembles these more recent forecast, we would expect to see further increase in the allowance for credit losses.
Capital ratios on slide 12 include the impact of CECL and incorporate applicable regulatory transition period.
As we've shared in the past, our target capital ratios were determined through our routine internal capital adequacy assessment process and include the capital optimization efforts completed in 2019.
These capital ratios give us comfort that even in a severely adverse scenario we have a sufficient buffer to withstand the losses and our main well capital.
In the first quarter, our CET1 ratio declined 8.72% largely due to the increase in risk-weighted assets, which accounted for a reduction of 25 basis points.
Our continued strength and PPNR generated 39 basis points of capital, which more than offset the 21 basis point impact of CECL related allowance build.
As a result of CECL, we anticipate capital ratio degradation earlier in a recessionary environment than under prior accounting guidance.
However, it is that allowance, which will provide a significant buffer to absorb any realized losses later in the cycle and affords us the ability to return to our capital targets over-time.
Currently, the allowance bill was reflected in the total risk-based capital ratio, which increased 6 basis points from the prior quarter to 12.31%.
Based on the same framework that was established and utilized for stress testing under the Dodd-Frank Act, we continue to leverage our internal capital management processes.
These processes coupled with our risk appetite framework provide a road map and outlines capital preservation strategies in the event we see a more protracted period of economic weakness.
As we navigate through this recession, we will be very diligent in how we deploy our balance sheet with a clear prioritization toward core customer relationships.
These processes also govern how we consider share repurchases in our common equity dividend.
Through this process, we determined to suspend our previously approved share repurchase program.
We continually evaluate our approach to common equity dividends in our capital planning process, which is guided by our assessment of capital adequacy as well as our projection of sustainable long-term earnings.
We believe a change in the common dividend is not warranted at this time.
As discussed, we remain confident in our capital adequacy and we continuously assess our long-term earnings outlook.
Liquidity management has always been a priority at Synovus and we continue to improve our liquidity profile.
In the first quarter, we issued $400 million of bank debt at very attractive levels and we increased our collateral of the Federal Home Loan Bank by approximately $2 billion.
As shown on slide 13, you can see that we have approximately $14 billion in readily available balance sheet liquidity.
While we expect loan balances excluding P3 loans to remain fairly flat over the near term, we do anticipate considerable second quarter growth associated with our P3 lending effort.
To best manage our risk and to maintain our existing funding sources for other customer need.
we anticipate using the Federal Reserve's P3 lending facility to support funding for at least a portion of these loans.
We believe that this is the most effective way to manage our overall liquidity position and to mitigate the associated impact on our capital ratios.
Kevin will now share a deeper dive on credit portfolios most impacted by COVID, some details about our responses to this crisis and provide an update on Synovus forward.
Before I go into deeper detail on several industries where the COVID-19 crisis is currently having a greater impact on business operations, this seems like an appropriate time to take a deeper dive into the composition and the quality of our loan portfolio by category as well as the significance of the diversification and derisking benefits that have been realized since the last financial crisis.
The chart on the slide shows the key components of each of our three portfolio categories with the table on the bottom right showing the shift in the composition from 2009.
Our C&I book totaled $17.7 billion and is primarily comprised of general middle market and commercial banking clients across a diverse set of industries.
Within C&I, the specialty divisions such as senior housing and premium finance comprised about 14% of total loans and have been a significant contributor to our growth story while also possessing some of the best credit metrics over the last several years.
The overall portfolio is well diversified by industry and geography and is extremely granular with almost 35,000 loans with an average original loan balance of approximately $770,000.
The CRE portfolio is $10.7 billion and 86% of the book is comprised of income producing properties with multifamily office, shopping center and hotel being the largest property types within the portfolio.
We do adhere to a disciplined concentration management philosophy thus our largest CRE loan is less than $50 million with an average loan size of approximately $13 million.
This portfolio is diverse both from a geographic and property type standpoint with strong loan to value and debt service coverage levels.
As a result, this portfolio has continued to perform well and as it relates to net charge-offs, the CRE book is in a net recovery position over the last five quarters.
The consumer book is $10 billion, almost three quarters of the consumer portfolio is in mortgage and HELOC categories with the remainder in lending partnerships, credit cards and other consumer.
You can see by the credit score and loan to value statistics that this portfolio is super-prime and remains very healthy.
Under the existing economic conditions, we expect our consumer portfolio to decline in the near term as we decreased our appetite for unsecured lending and third party partnership purchases.
The last point I want to cover on this slide is the substantial improvement that we've made to the diversification and derisking of the entire loan portfolio.
From 2009 until first quarter of 2020 we have significantly reduced our exposure to one-to-four family residential land and investment properties as well as CRE in aggregate.
By simply utilizing historical loss rates, the remix of our portfolio alone would result in a 50% reduction in losses.
Combined with the improvements in underwriting and portfolio management, we would expect losses to decline even further when evaluating the impact of the severely adverse scenario.
Moving to slide 15.
While our entire loan portfolio is continuously assessed, we have introduced enhanced monitoring for the segments noted on slide 15.
These segments totaling $4.6 billion had been identified as having a more direct and immediate impact from the COVID-19 crisis.
We are continuously working with our customers to evaluate how the current economic conditions are impacting their business operations and ultimately their cash burn rate.
We are leveraging payment deferments as well as the CARES Act stimulus programs to help weather short-term financial effects.
Solid underwriting and strong credit performance coupled with stronger balance sheets that have been built during our extended expansionary period give us confidence that these portfolios enter this downturn in the best possible position.
In the appendix on slides 27 through 29 you will find more detail around each of these portfolios, but I will touch on a few of them now.
Our hotel book is over 85% franchised and primarily contains non-resort properties, more than 90% of our hotels are rated upper mid scale or above.
This portfolio has strong credit metrics with an average loan to value of 54% and debt service coverage ratios of 1.9 times.
We have about $1 billion of shopping center exposure to centers that aren't grocery pharmacy or discount store-anchored.
Based on our southeastern footprint, these locations are situated markets that have continue to see good population and household income growth, which has created growth and stability for these businesses.
As such, these portfolios continue to perform well from a credit quality standpoint.
The restaurant book is $800 million with 56% of the book in limited service restaurants and 40% in full service.
Over 60% of our restaurants are franchises and have an average loan size at origination of roughly $1.5 million.
The next 2 industries are non-essential retail trade and arts entertainment and recreation, combining for $1.2 billion in outstandings.
Both of these portfolios have performed well pre-crisis and are also very granular with average loan sizes at origination of $1.8 million and $1.2 million respectively.
Lastly, I will mention are relatively small exposure to oil-related industries at less than 1% of total loans.
Given our five state footprint, oil is not a prevalent industry, particularly as it relates to exploration and production.
Most of our exposures and transportation operations and support related to the industry.
This portfolio has exhibited strong credit performance, but given the current state of the oil industry, we are more closely monitoring our exposure.
Our bankers and credit team members continue to work with and provide financial advice and consultation to our customers and ensure we are providing the necessary support to mitigate the short-term disruption and cash flows.
As with our entire credit portfolio, each of these portfolios has exhibited strong performance over the trailing quarters and years and was as well positioned as could be expected coming into the current environment.
The duration of the downturn will obviously determine the impact on these businesses and how quickly these industries will return to more normalized cash flow levels.
Despite rolling out our Synovus forward playbook in March, we quickly reconfigured our efforts to focus on our COVID response starting with the safety and well-being of our team members who are vitally important to support our customers as well as the communities we serve.
We effectively exercised our business continuity plan, which enables our employees to work remotely while continuing to provide customer facing roles in our branches and call centers to meet the needs of our customers.
And quite frankly, that was our other primary focus, the safety and continued service of our customers.
Although we continue to practice social distancing, we are here to serve our customers and continue to provide advice and new solutions to help them navigate the changing business climate and support their business operations.
In fact, during the first quarter, we implemented over 6,000 new services in our Treasury & Payment Solutions area, which represented a 320% increase over the first quarter of 2019.
This is another proof point of our continued commitment to serve our customers and our ability to do so in a difficult climate.
And despite the crisis, our bankers continue to call on and on-board new prospects as our relationship-based approach is serving as a key differentiator in this trying environment.
We are going to deploy our capital in areas where we receive optimal returns and while this business approach may produce lower loan growth in aggregate, we will continue to focus on acquiring new full service relationships and deepening our current relationships with new opportunities.
As we have mentioned, we've also taken a proactive approach to providing relief to our customers when needed from waving fees to increasing ATM and mobile deposit limits to granting deferments on loan payments.
Our loan deferment program is constructed to allow smaller loans upon request to receive a short-term 90-day deferral of interest and principal to the maturity date of the loan.
For larger loans, we have initiated a credit driven approach to review the specific circumstances of each request, annualized cash burn and obtain updated financial information while determining the need for the deferment.
To-date, our percentage of total deferrals is around 13% of the overall portfolio with those industries more directly impacted by COVID-19 carrying higher percentages.
We also have closely monitored all of the stimulus actions and programs made available by the CARES Act.
Obviously the paycheck protection program has had the greatest impact on our customers to this point.
We began the P3 process on March 28 with an online expression of interest portal.
We began taking applications on April 3rd, the day the program went live.
As Kessel mentioned earlier, as of today, we have secured funding for over 8,000 customers for approximately $2 billion.
As I close, let me transition to the future at Synovus Forward.
As we shared during an investor conference in March, Synovus Forward is our newly formed program that was built to generate an incremental $100 million of pre-tax income in the coming years and to lead to top quartile performance among mid cap banks in terms of profitability and efficiency.
During the development of this program, we evaluated over 20 unique and distinct initiatives that included a combination of expense and revenue opportunities.
We are confirming today that the incremental opportunity is still very achievable.
However, many of the benefits have been delayed due to the focus on the current crisis.
Many of the expense and revenue initiatives that were planned for the first half of 2020 will be recast into the second half of the year or in early 2021.
While we have had to delay some initiatives, we are also accelerating actions in others.
This includes increasing the efficiencies gained from the third-party spend initiatives, accelerating the development of digital and analytical capabilities to drive growth and manage risk and leveraging our remote environment to aggressively think about our physical distribution and locations.
We have also continue to invest in technology and more specifically, My Synovus, our consumer digital portal.
In March, we deployed major updates to enhance the bill-pay and transfer experiences of our customers.
And as we made improvements, we've seen higher levels of enrollment and utilization while seeing our overall operating increase and it's important to note that the current crisis is creating opportunities to add new initiatives to the portfolio and resize current initiatives that we had planned.
The Synovus Forward portfolio is not rigid it and will continue to evolve we are committed to delivering and growing the value as we address new economic and customer behavior realities.
There is much work ahead of us and we understand the need to balance both short term and long-term priorities.
The end state benefits, their timing and sizing may continue to evolve in this fluid environment.
And for a brief update on the weeks activities just wanted to share that on Wednesday, we hosted our first online only virtual shareholder meeting.
Among other actions our shareholders overwhelmingly approved the elimination of our 10 -1 voting structure and super majority voting requirements.
These changes reflect our Board's continuing commitment to best-in-class corporate governance.

"
11,"For the benefit of our participants, we have posted slides, which accompany our discussion.
And these slides are available on the Investor Relations page of dieboldnixdorf.com.
In the supplemental schedules of our slides, we have reconciled each non-GAAP metric to its most directly comparable GAAP metric.
Additional information on these factors can be found in the company's SEC filings.
And now I will pass the microphone to Gerrard.
We were very pleased with our results this quarter, and Jeff will get into details.
From our perspective, we are executing in line with our strategy.
We delivered stronger-than-expected orders, especially in Eurasia Banking and retail.
While revenue was in line with our pre-COVID expectations, and we continue to deliver strong year-over-year improvements in profitability.
Starting on Slide 3, I'll describe our near-term priorities.
From the earlier stages of the crisis in January, our first priority has been on protecting the health and well-being of our employees.
Our second priority is on our mission to deliver essential services as designated by the U.S. government and many other governments around the world.
Almost 100% of our banking revenue and around 65% of our retail revenue is generated from customers that are essential businesses.
I'm extremely pleased that we have consistently delivered strong service levels: banks, grocery stores, pharmacies and fuel and convenience locations, which facilitate critical day-to-day commerce.
Thirdly, we are committed to strengthening Diebold Nixdorf during this crisis.
This means leveraging the operational rigor we have forged over the past two years to drive efficiencies in our business.
It also means we are taking further steps to maintain adequate liquidity and ensure financial flexibility.
Our response to pandemic is guided by our company values, shown on the right side of the slide, which have been in place and have underpinned our progress over the past two years.
Our employees are using technology to collaborate on an unprecedented scale to meet customer needs and address business challenges.
This is taking place despite the social distancing protocols we operate under.
We're acting with a great sense of urgency and decisiveness as we seek to enhance the way we do business, for the betterment of customers and shareholders.
And more than ever, our team is stepping up to hold one another accountable.
On Slide 4, I'd like to add more color to our comprehensive response plans.
Starting with our customers and solutions.
We are delivering strong service levels, which reinforce our value proposition, even in the hardest-hit areas of the world.
In turn, our customers have affirmed our value and the criticality of the ATM and retail checkout channels.
Two recent customer quotes on this slide, one from a European grocer and the other from a large financial institution in the U.S., up to the essence of our value proposition.
And we continue to enhance our differentiation by bringing to market our DN Series next-generation banking solutions, self-checkout solutions, dynamic software and our IoT-enabled AllConnect Data Engine.
Turning to our employees.
We've gone to great lengths since early January to proactively care for their health and well-being.
We have equipped our service technicians with the appropriate protective gear and trained them on relevant hygiene and social distancing rules.
For employees and our manufacturing facilities, we have segmented our workers, intensified our cleaning rituals and are taking temperatures on a daily basis.
And for our support functions, we have provided the proper tools, resources and guidance for more than 10,000 employees to safely and productively work from home.
I'm pleased to report that our efforts are making a difference, and we are operating well in all areas of our business with no disruptions despite these circumstances.
We're also looking out for the financial health of employees as well during this tumultuous time, by establishing an employee crisis reserve fund, which is available for employees who need support, especially in markets with limited government programs.
In recognition of the tremendous efforts of our frontline service employees during this challenging time, we have provided an extra week of pay.
Additionally, our company has increased the frequency and depth of its internal communications.
In return, we're seeing strong employee engagement and resourcefulness during this crisis.
In addition, I'm pleased to see Diebold Nixdorf actively supporting our communities.
In Ohio, we've been producing face shields and shipping them to medical facilities in need.
In Germany, we started manufacturing ventilated carriages.
Our manufacturing facilities are all online and performing well.
With respect to our global supply chains, members of our response team have been vigorously engaged since January to avoid major disruptions by maintaining frequent contact with our key suppliers, monitoring safety stocks and developing contingency plans.
While COVID-19 is likely to remain as a watch item for supply chains over the coming quarters, we are currently pleased with our ability to limit the impact.
Our comprehensive response is leveraging the operating rigor, which we've created during the past two years.
We continue to efficiently manage inventory, receivables and payables, as well as indirect spend.
And we are keenly focused on maintaining adequate liquidity and financial flexibility.
After an abundance of caution, we drew the remaining amount on our revolving credit facility in March.
On Slide 5, we provided a framework for thinking about the impact of COVID-19 on Diebold Nixdorf over the medium term.
Firstly, our business model is resilient.
Underpinned by many customers, reaffirming that the ATM and self-checkout channels are vital to their business, and that our company plays a critical role in their ability to serve the needs of their customers.
Starting with our services business, which generated about 51% of total revenue in 2019, we expect a mild impact as the vast majority of our services revenues are recurring.
It comes from sticky contracts for maintaining critical ATMs and retail devices.
In the near term, we're likely to see a slowdown for installation service revenue.
Certain hardware-related projects are pushed out.
For our products business, which accounted for about 39% of revenue in 2019, we expect to see a moderate impact of certain customers postpone installation dates or defer new hardware purchases.
In the first quarter, we experienced early signs within our European retail and Eurasia Banking segments, which corresponds to the geographic spread of the virus.
And while we did not see an acceleration of these trends in April, it is reasonable to expect that product revenue declines will be more pronounced in the second quarter.
We've taken multiple steps within our manufacturing operations to create a variable cost structure to help us mitigate the impact of lower volume on our profitability.
Moving to our software business.
We generate recurring revenue from the sale of licenses and maintenance, which we expect will be very resilient.
Our project-based business, or professional services, could be affected by customers deferring initiatives, although we have experienced very limited impact to date.
The vast majority of our customers are continuing this important work.
Additionally, our software teams have done a great job of supporting customers remotely.
For these reasons, we expect a mild impact to our software revenue, which accounted for about 11% of total company revenue in 2019.
From an industry perspective, we expect our banking business, which generated approximately 74% of the company's revenue during 2019, will show greater resiliency in our retail business, due to the higher mix of services and software revenues.
So while we are confident in the resilience of our business model, we've not been standing still during this time.
We continue to take further decisive actions to strengthen Diebold Nixdorf.
On Slide 6, you will see that we continue to execute on our multiyear DN Now cost program.
We remain encouraged with our achievements, including substantial gains in profit margins during the first quarter.
We are seeing good progress from our services modernization plans and our G&A cost reduction actions, especially our finance transformation efforts.
And while COVID-19 pandemic has mildly influenced select work streams, we are continuing to pursue our gross savings target of $130 million for the year.
Additionally, the company launched incremental actions during the quarter, which cumulatively add up to another $80 million to $100 million of savings.
We have suspended capital investments on internal major projects, mostly related to the upgrading of systems.
During the quarter, we also reduced our annual bonus expense by a substantial amount.
We have deferred merit pay increases and have implemented a hiring freeze.
In several European markets, we have transitioned certain functions to shorter work weeks.
We continue to reduce indirect spend.
And based on our successful transition to remote work environment, we have reassessed our global real estate footprint and are taking decisive actions to further reduce our footprint over the coming months.
While some of these cost reductions will be temporary, others will generate long-term structural savings for our company.
Beginning on Slide 7.
First-quarter revenue of $911 million was in line with our pre COVID 19 expectation and reflects the actions we are taking to drive higher quality revenue.
In order to make useful comparisons to the prior year, we have provided a table to explain five different factors.
Our work stream for divesting noncore businesses accounted for approximately $13 million of revenue variance versus the first quarter of 2019.
Next, you can see a $17 million variance from our efforts to reduce our exposure to low-margin business with most of the impact relating to our actions to call our portfolio of lower value services contracts.
On the borrowing line, you will see a $31 million variance, which includes nonrecurring volume from the prior year period, partially offset by incremental activity in the current quarter.
These items were fully known and planned for as part of our 2020 operating plan.
We have previously communicated our expectation for year-over-year revenue declines in the first half followed by gains in the second half of the year.
With respect to foreign currency, we experienced headwinds of $23 million in the quarter as the U.S. dollar strengthened primarily against the euro and Brazilian real.
COVID-19 is the last factor on this table.
Approximately $33 million of revenue, which we expected to recognize in the first quarter of 2020, will be recognized in future periods.
This effect was predominantly in our retail and Eurasia Banking segments.
Transitioning to the right of this slide, you will see the combined efforts of higher-quality revenue and our DN Now initiatives, as non-GAAP gross profit increased $7 million year over year.
We achieved this positive result despite the effects of COVID-19 and a foreign currency headwind of approximately $7 million in the quarter.
From a gross margin perspective, we are pleased to deliver a 380-basis-point increase year over year to 27.9%.
On $911 million of revenue, this increase translates to approximately $35 million of incremental gross profit.
We are delivering significant margin increase across all three business lines, with services rising by 230 basis points, products expanding 280 basis points, and our software and gross margin increased by 1,280 basis points due to an easier comp, as well as better delivery and management of our labor costs.
Over to Slide 8.
As previously mentioned, the company is harvesting operating efficiencies and from functional G&A cost as part of our DN Now transformation.
We made good progress on our finance transformation, which includes regionalizing and centralizing activities, and introducing automation within our core finance functions.
Through the end of March, we have streamlined our organization by approximately 470 employees.
Our procurement initiative is also bearing results as we are utilizing spend analytics to reduce indirect spend.
With respect to real estate expenses, we are looking closely at our needs post COVID.
We have demonstrated a highly resilient ability to work remotely.
And accordingly, we are aggressively moving to reduce our real estate footprint.
In the past several weeks, we have decided to close greater than 50 smaller sites permanently.
When compared with the prior year, we reduced our non-GAAP operating expenses by $29 million, a decline of 13%.
Given this success, we expect to continue to deliver G&A efficiencies going forward.
As displayed on Slide 9, stronger gross margin, coupled with reductions to operating expense, boosted our operating profit by $36 million or 133% year over year to $63 million.
The operating margin expanded by 430 basis points in the quarter to 6.9%.
Our first-quarter results include a reduction to our annual bonus expense of approximately $7 million, which is just one of our incremental actions we have executed to strengthen the company during the COVID-19 period.
Adjusted EBITDA of $89 million improved by $24 million or 37% over the prior-year period.
The company's adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 350 basis points in the quarter to 9.8%.
The next three slides provide segment-level financial information.
In order to make the year-on-year comparisons more meaningful, we introduced adjusted revenue and gross profit for the first quarter of 2019, which removes the effects of foreign currency and divestitures.
We are showing gross profit on these slides to more closely reflect how we are running the business.
However, we will continue to disclose segment operating profit in the MD&A section of our Form 10-Q.
As Gerrard mentioned earlier, Eurasia Banking delivered very strong orders in the first quarter and built up a nice backlog.
These wins included a new ATM-as-a-Service contract with Bank99 in Austria, valued at more than $20 million in a branch transformation win, valued at more than $13 million with a large Saudi Arabian financial institution.
Moving to Slide 10.
First-quarter revenue of $311 million was in line with our pre-COVID expectations.
Approximately $13 million of the revenue decline was due to our divestiture activity, while $8 million was due to our delivered actions taken in 2019 to reduce low-margin business.
Additionally, certain large hardware installations benefited 2019 revenue, which did not continue in 2020.
Delays from the COVID-19 pandemic pushed approximately $14 million of revenue into future periods.
Non-GAAP gross profit of $90 million in the quarter and a gross margin of 28.9% reflects the resiliency of this segment as we benefit from our DN Now services modernization and software excellence initiatives, as well as our intentional actions to reduce low-margin business.
First-quarter gross profit includes a foreign currency headwind of approximately $4 million versus the prior-year period.
On Slide 11, Americas Banking revenue of $345 million reflects a 3% decline, primarily due to our constant decision to exit lower margin service contracts.
Within our products revenue, we are seeing good growth from U.S. regional financial institutions, although nonrecurring projects at large banks in North America eased year over year as we had expected.
During the quarter, we were especially pleased to generate software revenue growth of 13% in constant currency.
Gross profit of $104 million for the quarter increased 30% versus the prior year due to the execution of our DN Now initiatives and a favorable customer mix.
We were pleased to expand gross margins from 22.7% to 30.3%, with meaningful contributions from all three business lines.
Key to our success was services gross margin of 32.1% for this segment, reflecting very good performance from our services modernization initiative.
Slide 12 contains financial highlights for our retail segment.
From an orders perspective, retail performed as we expected and was in line with the prior-year period.
Revenue of $256 million primarily reflects lower POS installation activity in Europe, partially offset by growth in self-checkout hardware and higher software activity.
Both results came in as expected.
The impact of the pandemic was more acute in this segment, pushing approximately $19 million of revenue out of the quarter.
Gross profit increased to $60 million, up 11% in the quarter, and gross margin improved significantly to 23.4% due to a favorable revenue mix from services software and self-checkout solutions, as well as solid progress with our services modernization and software excellence program.
Our cash flow update is on Slide 13.
As we discussed previously, the company has been consistent and are disciplined in managing our net working capital over the past several quarters.
Net working capital as a percentage of trailing 12-month revenue declined steadily over the last seven quarters, down to 13.3% in the first quarter of 2020, down from 19.1% a year ago, due primarily to more efficient management of inventory and accounts payable.
From a cash flow perspective, net working capital drove a $15 million benefit year over year.
Because of our focus, we believe the company is well prepared to manage net working capital during the current challenging economic conditions.
As communicated previously, the company typically uses cash during the first half of the year and our free cash use of $65 million in the quarter was slightly better than our expectations and slightly improved versus one year ago.
First-quarter results include an incremental $35 million of compensation-related cash payments tied to our strong 2019 performance.
Adjusting for this item, you can clearly see that we are delivering high-quality earnings in addition to our net working capital efficiencies.
Towards the bottom of the slide, we bridge our cash balances from the end of 2019 through the end of March.
We used approximately $71 million to pay down debt.
This includes our amortization payments, as well as our contractual requirement to reduce debt with at least half of our free cash flow from the prior year.
Since I have already discussed our free cash flow, the next item is cash inflow from our revolving credit facility.
We drew the entire available amount from our facility in March out of an abundance of caution in light of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic and related macroeconomic implications.
This action has almost no impact on our expected cash interest payments of approximately $170 million because the incremental interest on the revolver will largely be offset by lower LIBOR rates for other debt instruments.
An additional $89 million reduction of cash is attributed to foreign currency headwinds experienced in the quarter, plus the effect of selling our 68% stake in the German IT outsourcing business called, Portavis and one other pending transaction.
With a cash balance of $549 million at the end of March, we believe we have adequate liquidity to fund the seasonal cash flows of our business and our DN Now transformation program.
On Slide 14, we highlight our debt maturities and leverage ratio.
Our contractual debt maturities of $98 million for 2020 and $26 million for 2021 are manageable under our current liquidity model.
We continue to monitor the debt markets relative to our strategy to address our 2022 debt maturities.
At the appropriate time, we will take steps to optimize our capital structure by reducing our weighted average cost of capital, lowering interest rates and extending maturities.
To the right of the slide, we have provided our net debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA ratio for the past five quarters.
As you can see, we have steadily improved this metric and we are pleased to maintain the 4.4 times ratio in the first quarter as our adjusted EBITDA gains offset the changes to net debt.
This compares favorably to our bank covenant maximum of 7 times.
Our net debt on 31st March was approximately $1.9 billion.
Moving to Slide 15.
I will build upon Gerrard's comments about the financial resiliency of our business model and provide a few guideposts for understanding how we expect to perform under challenging macroeconomic conditions.
For your convenience, we have provided selected financial results from 2019, including revenue and gross margin for services, products and software.
We expect our services business to be resilient during this time, with a mild impact to revenue.
As previously disclosed, we expect to complete two divestitures in 2020, which generated about $110 million of services revenue for the company in 2019.
One of these transactions closed in Q1, with the other expected to close in Q2, subject to customary closing conditions.
Additionally, the software we deliver for our customers is critical to their performance, and therefore, we expect a mild impact for COVID-19 to this business line.
With respect to product revenue, we expect a moderate impact based on what we have seen thus far, as well as the company's experience from prior recessions.
Given the timing of the crisis, it is reasonable to expect a more significant impact of product revenue in the second quarter as certain product installations are expected to be delayed during country lockdowns while other hardware orders are postponed.
Our current cost structure and incremental action plans provide us with the confidence to improve gross margins during this challenging time.
We are targeting improvements to service margins due to our actions to improve the quality of revenue and execution of the services modernization plan.
For products, we expect to deliver broadly stable gross margin due to our variable cost structure and our solid performance in the first quarter, inclusive of some level of higher freight costs.
At the same time, we expect to improve our software margins versus the prior year due to better project execution and more efficient utilization of labor.
Moving to operating profit.
We expect to benefit from our DN Now initiatives and our plans for realizing approximately $130 million of savings for 2020.
And while COVID-19 is having a mild influence on select DN Now work streams, we have also launched incremental actions to generate $80 million to $100 million of savings, as Gerrard described.
These actions include: accelerating our finance transformation, streamlining indirect spend, significantly lower bonus expense and other labor savings, reduced travel and marketing expenditures and savings from our real estate and information technology initiatives.
Together with our net working capital efficiencies and cash management actions, we are targeting breakeven free cash flow for 2020.
By minimizing the uses of cash, we will maintain adequate liquidity and covenant compliance through 2020.
In summary, this leadership team has taken significant and appropriate action to strengthen the company during these challenging times.
Our accomplishment, near-term plans and company values provide us with the confidence to persevere.
We are hard at work executing these plans, and we are developing additional levers to be used as needed.
And now I will hand the call back to Gerrard for closing comments.
I'd like to conclude on Slide 16 with a few reminders about why we believe Diebold Nixdorf is well-positioned to persevere through this crisis and emerge as a stronger company.
I'll also provide a few color comments regarding April.
First, we've been designated as an essential service provider to financial institutions and retailers.
Our customers are counting on us to keep their businesses running.
And during this crisis, the criticality of the ATM channel, point-of-sale and self-checkout channels have been reaffirmed strongly.
Next, our position as a trusted technology partner produces strong recurring revenue streams, which underpins a resilient business model.
Furthermore, our leadership team has demonstrated resiliency and an ability to execute complex transformation initiatives over the past two years.
Considering DN's operational rigor and our incremental cost actions in place, we are confident in our ability to navigate the current environment and emerge as a strong company.
Before we turn over to Q&A, let me offer a few thoughts on what we saw in April.
From an order entry perspective, we are seeing a moderate slowing in hardware decisions from customers in Eurasia Banking and retail, where projects are being delayed and not canceled.
Within Eurasia banking, these delays tend to be mostly evident within smaller Tier 2 banks.
Within Americas Banking, order activity has remained largely in line with our pre-COVID expectations.
Regarding installations, we have seen some hardware installations push out, typically by several weeks as customers focus on other priorities.
In April, our factories shipped more volume than in the same period of 2019, reflecting the backlog as we entered Q2, even though we may see some implementations pushed out of Q2.
From a services perspective, we continue to be fully engaged with customers in delivering strong service levels.
And from a software perspective, we've not seen any delays in professional services projects from larger customers, but the only delays observed among Tier 2 and Tier 3 customers.
Overall, employee morale remains strong as we rally around our customers' needs and implement incremental actions to strengthen Diebold Nixdorf.
In closing, while the current operating environment is dynamic, we remain confident in our people, our mission and in the resiliency of our business.
We stand ready to support our customers as the global economic economy recovers.
Our confidence is based on the DN Now foundation we've built over the last two years, the robust plans we're executing and the tremendous response we're seeing from Diebold Nixdorf employees who are living out at company values.

We are delivering significant margin increase across all three business lines, with services rising by 230 basis points, products expanding 280 basis points, and our software and gross margin increased by 1,280 basis points due to an easier comp, as well as better delivery and management of our labor costs.
Over to Slide 8.
As previously mentioned, the company is harvesting operating efficiencies and from functional G&A cost as part of our DN Now transformation.
We made good progress on our finance transformation, which includes regionalizing and centralizing activities, and introducing automation within our core finance functions.
Through the end of March, we have streamlined our organization by approximately 470 employees.
Our procurement initiative is also bearing results as we are utilizing spend analytics to reduce indirect spend.
With respect to real estate expenses, we are looking closely at our needs post COVID.
We have demonstrated a highly resilient ability to work remotely.
And accordingly, we are aggressively moving to reduce our real estate footprint.
In the past several weeks, we have decided to close greater than 50 smaller sites permanently.
When compared with the prior year, we reduced our non-GAAP operating expenses by $29 million, a decline of 13%.
Given this success, we expect to continue to deliver G&A efficiencies going forward.
As displayed on Slide 9, stronger gross margin, coupled with reductions to operating expense, boosted our operating profit by $36 million or 133% year over year to $63 million.
The operating margin expanded by 430 basis points in the quarter to 6.9%.
Our first-quarter results include a reduction to our annual bonus expense of approximately $7 million, which is just one of our incremental actions we have executed to strengthen the company during the COVID-19 period.
Adjusted EBITDA of $89 million improved by $24 million or 37% over the prior-year period.
The company's adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 350 basis points in the quarter to 9.8%.
The next three slides provide segment-level financial information.
In order to make the year-on-year comparisons more meaningful, we introduced adjusted revenue and gross profit for the first quarter of 2019, which removes the effects of foreign currency and divestitures.
We are showing gross profit on these slides to more closely reflect how we are running the business.
However, we will continue to disclose segment operating profit in the MD&A section of our Form 10-Q.
As Gerrard mentioned earlier, Eurasia Banking delivered very strong orders in the first quarter and built up a nice backlog.
These wins included a new ATM-as-a-Service contract with Bank99 in Austria, valued at more than $20 million in a branch transformation win, valued at more than $13 million with a large Saudi Arabian financial institution.
Moving to Slide 10.
First-quarter revenue of $311 million was in line with our pre-COVID expectations.
Approximately $13 million of the revenue decline was due to our divestiture activity, while $8 million was due to our delivered actions taken in 2019 to reduce low-margin business.
Additionally, certain large hardware installations benefited 2019 revenue, which did not continue in 2020.
Delays from the COVID-19 pandemic pushed approximately $14 million of revenue into future periods.
Non-GAAP gross profit of $90 million in the quarter and a gross margin of 28.9% reflects the resiliency of this segment as we benefit from our DN Now services modernization and software excellence initiatives, as well as our intentional actions to reduce low-margin business.
First-quarter gross profit includes a foreign currency headwind of approximately $4 million versus the prior-year period.
On Slide 11, Americas Banking revenue of $345 million reflects a 3% decline, primarily due to our constant decision to exit lower margin service contracts.
Within our products revenue, we are seeing good growth from U.S. regional financial institutions, although nonrecurring projects at large banks in North America eased year over year as we had expected.
During the quarter, we were especially pleased to generate software revenue growth of 13% in constant currency.
Gross profit of $104 million for the quarter increased 30% versus the prior year due to the execution of our DN Now initiatives and a favorable customer mix.
We were pleased to expand gross margins from 22.7% to 30.3%, with meaningful contributions from all three business lines.
Key to our success was services gross margin of 32.1% for this segment, reflecting very good performance from our services modernization initiative.
Slide 12 contains financial highlights for our retail segment.
From an orders perspective, retail performed as we expected and was in line with the prior-year period.
Revenue of $256 million primarily reflects lower POS installation activity in Europe, partially offset by growth in self-checkout hardware and higher software activity.
Both results came in as expected.

The impact of the pandemic was more acute in this segment, pushing approximately $19",11,"For the benefit of our participants, we have posted slides, which accompany our discussion.
And these slides are available on the Investor Relations page of dieboldnixdorf.com.
In the supplemental schedules of our slides, we have reconciled each non-GAAP metric to its most directly comparable GAAP metric.
Additional information on these factors can be found in the company's SEC filings.
And now I will pass the microphone to Gerrard.
We were very pleased with our results this quarter, and Jeff will get into details.
From our perspective, we are executing in line with our strategy.
We delivered stronger-than-expected orders, especially in Eurasia Banking and retail.
While revenue was in line with our pre-COVID expectations, and we continue to deliver strong year-over-year improvements in profitability.
Starting on Slide 3, I'll describe our near-term priorities.
From the earlier stages of the crisis in January, our first priority has been on protecting the health and well-being of our employees.
Our second priority is on our mission to deliver essential services as designated by the U.S. government and many other governments around the world.
Almost 100% of our banking revenue and around 65% of our retail revenue is generated from customers that are essential businesses.
I'm extremely pleased that we have consistently delivered strong service levels: banks, grocery stores, pharmacies and fuel and convenience locations, which facilitate critical day-to-day commerce.
Thirdly, we are committed to strengthening Diebold Nixdorf during this crisis.
This means leveraging the operational rigor we have forged over the past two years to drive efficiencies in our business.
It also means we are taking further steps to maintain adequate liquidity and ensure financial flexibility.
Our response to pandemic is guided by our company values, shown on the right side of the slide, which have been in place and have underpinned our progress over the past two years.
Our employees are using technology to collaborate on an unprecedented scale to meet customer needs and address business challenges.
This is taking place despite the social distancing protocols we operate under.
We're acting with a great sense of urgency and decisiveness as we seek to enhance the way we do business, for the betterment of customers and shareholders.
And more than ever, our team is stepping up to hold one another accountable.
On Slide 4, I'd like to add more color to our comprehensive response plans.
Starting with our customers and solutions.
We are delivering strong service levels, which reinforce our value proposition, even in the hardest-hit areas of the world.
In turn, our customers have affirmed our value and the criticality of the ATM and retail checkout channels.
Two recent customer quotes on this slide, one from a European grocer and the other from a large financial institution in the U.S., up to the essence of our value proposition.
And we continue to enhance our differentiation by bringing to market our DN Series next-generation banking solutions, self-checkout solutions, dynamic software and our IoT-enabled AllConnect Data Engine.
Turning to our employees.
We've gone to great lengths since early January to proactively care for their health and well-being.
We have equipped our service technicians with the appropriate protective gear and trained them on relevant hygiene and social distancing rules.
For employees and our manufacturing facilities, we have segmented our workers, intensified our cleaning rituals and are taking temperatures on a daily basis.
And for our support functions, we have provided the proper tools, resources and guidance for more than 10,000 employees to safely and productively work from home.
I'm pleased to report that our efforts are making a difference, and we are operating well in all areas of our business with no disruptions despite these circumstances.
We're also looking out for the financial health of employees as well during this tumultuous time, by establishing an employee crisis reserve fund, which is available for employees who need support, especially in markets with limited government programs.
In recognition of the tremendous efforts of our frontline service employees during this challenging time, we have provided an extra week of pay.
Additionally, our company has increased the frequency and depth of its internal communications.
In return, we're seeing strong employee engagement and resourcefulness during this crisis.
In addition, I'm pleased to see Diebold Nixdorf actively supporting our communities.
In Ohio, we've been producing face shields and shipping them to medical facilities in need.
In Germany, we started manufacturing ventilated carriages.
Our manufacturing facilities are all online and performing well.
With respect to our global supply chains, members of our response team have been vigorously engaged since January to avoid major disruptions by maintaining frequent contact with our key suppliers, monitoring safety stocks and developing contingency plans.
While COVID-19 is likely to remain as a watch item for supply chains over the coming quarters, we are currently pleased with our ability to limit the impact.
Our comprehensive response is leveraging the operating rigor, which we've created during the past two years.
We continue to efficiently manage inventory, receivables and payables, as well as indirect spend.
And we are keenly focused on maintaining adequate liquidity and financial flexibility.
After an abundance of caution, we drew the remaining amount on our revolving credit facility in March.
On Slide 5, we provided a framework for thinking about the impact of COVID-19 on Diebold Nixdorf over the medium term.
Firstly, our business model is resilient.
Underpinned by many customers, reaffirming that the ATM and self-checkout channels are vital to their business, and that our company plays a critical role in their ability to serve the needs of their customers.
Starting with our services business, which generated about 51% of total revenue in 2019, we expect a mild impact as the vast majority of our services revenues are recurring.
It comes from sticky contracts for maintaining critical ATMs and retail devices.
In the near term, we're likely to see a slowdown for installation service revenue.
Certain hardware-related projects are pushed out.
For our products business, which accounted for about 39% of revenue in 2019, we expect to see a moderate impact of certain customers postpone installation dates or defer new hardware purchases.
In the first quarter, we experienced early signs within our European retail and Eurasia Banking segments, which corresponds to the geographic spread of the virus.
And while we did not see an acceleration of these trends in April, it is reasonable to expect that product revenue declines will be more pronounced in the second quarter.
We've taken multiple steps within our manufacturing operations to create a variable cost structure to help us mitigate the impact of lower volume on our profitability.
Moving to our software business.
We generate recurring revenue from the sale of licenses and maintenance, which we expect will be very resilient.
Our project-based business, or professional services, could be affected by customers deferring initiatives, although we have experienced very limited impact to date.
The vast majority of our customers are continuing this important work.
Additionally, our software teams have done a great job of supporting customers remotely.
For these reasons, we expect a mild impact to our software revenue, which accounted for about 11% of total company revenue in 2019.
From an industry perspective, we expect our banking business, which generated approximately 74% of the company's revenue during 2019, will show greater resiliency in our retail business, due to the higher mix of services and software revenues.
So while we are confident in the resilience of our business model, we've not been standing still during this time.
We continue to take further decisive actions to strengthen Diebold Nixdorf.
On Slide 6, you will see that we continue to execute on our multiyear DN Now cost program.
We remain encouraged with our achievements, including substantial gains in profit margins during the first quarter.
We are seeing good progress from our services modernization plans and our G&A cost reduction actions, especially our finance transformation efforts.
And while COVID-19 pandemic has mildly influenced select work streams, we are continuing to pursue our gross savings target of $130 million for the year.
Additionally, the company launched incremental actions during the quarter, which cumulatively add up to another $80 million to $100 million of savings.
We have suspended capital investments on internal major projects, mostly related to the upgrading of systems.
During the quarter, we also reduced our annual bonus expense by a substantial amount.
We have deferred merit pay increases and have implemented a hiring freeze.
In several European markets, we have transitioned certain functions to shorter work weeks.
We continue to reduce indirect spend.
And based on our successful transition to remote work environment, we have reassessed our global real estate footprint and are taking decisive actions to further reduce our footprint over the coming months.
While some of these cost reductions will be temporary, others will generate long-term structural savings for our company.
Beginning on Slide 7.
First-quarter revenue of $911 million was in line with our pre COVID 19 expectation and reflects the actions we are taking to drive higher quality revenue.
In order to make useful comparisons to the prior year, we have provided a table to explain five different factors.
Our work stream for divesting noncore businesses accounted for approximately $13 million of revenue variance versus the first quarter of 2019.
Next, you can see a $17 million variance from our efforts to reduce our exposure to low-margin business with most of the impact relating to our actions to call our portfolio of lower value services contracts.
On the borrowing line, you will see a $31 million variance, which includes nonrecurring volume from the prior year period, partially offset by incremental activity in the current quarter.
These items were fully known and planned for as part of our 2020 operating plan.
We have previously communicated our expectation for year-over-year revenue declines in the first half followed by gains in the second half of the year.
With respect to foreign currency, we experienced headwinds of $23 million in the quarter as the U.S. dollar strengthened primarily against the euro and Brazilian real.
COVID-19 is the last factor on this table.
Approximately $33 million of revenue, which we expected to recognize in the first quarter of 2020, will be recognized in future periods.
This effect was predominantly in our retail and Eurasia Banking segments.
Transitioning to the right of this slide, you will see the combined efforts of higher-quality revenue and our DN Now initiatives, as non-GAAP gross profit increased $7 million year over year.
We achieved this positive result despite the effects of COVID-19 and a foreign currency headwind of approximately $7 million in the quarter.
From a gross margin perspective, we are pleased to deliver a 380-basis-point increase year over year to 27.9%.
On $911 million of revenue, this increase translates to approximately $35 million of incremental gross profit.
We are delivering significant margin increase across all three business lines, with services rising by 230 basis points, products expanding 280 basis points, and our software and gross margin increased by 1,280 basis points due to an easier comp, as well as better delivery and management of our labor costs.
Over to Slide 8.
As previously mentioned, the company is harvesting operating efficiencies and from functional G&A cost as part of our DN Now transformation.
We made good progress on our finance transformation, which includes regionalizing and centralizing activities, and introducing automation within our core finance functions.
Through the end of March, we have streamlined our organization by approximately 470 employees.
Our procurement initiative is also bearing results as we are utilizing spend analytics to reduce indirect spend.
With respect to real estate expenses, we are looking closely at our needs post COVID.
We have demonstrated a highly resilient ability to work remotely.
And accordingly, we are aggressively moving to reduce our real estate footprint.
In the past several weeks, we have decided to close greater than 50 smaller sites permanently.
When compared with the prior year, we reduced our non-GAAP operating expenses by $29 million, a decline of 13%.
Given this success, we expect to continue to deliver G&A efficiencies going forward.
As displayed on Slide 9, stronger gross margin, coupled with reductions to operating expense, boosted our operating profit by $36 million or 133% year over year to $63 million.
The operating margin expanded by 430 basis points in the quarter to 6.9%.
Our first-quarter results include a reduction to our annual bonus expense of approximately $7 million, which is just one of our incremental actions we have executed to strengthen the company during the COVID-19 period.
Adjusted EBITDA of $89 million improved by $24 million or 37% over the prior-year period.
The company's adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 350 basis points in the quarter to 9.8%.
The next three slides provide segment-level financial information.
In order to make the year-on-year comparisons more meaningful, we introduced adjusted revenue and gross profit for the first quarter of 2019, which removes the effects of foreign currency and divestitures.
We are showing gross profit on these slides to more closely reflect how we are running the business.
However, we will continue to disclose segment operating profit in the MD&A section of our Form 10-Q.
As Gerrard mentioned earlier, Eurasia Banking delivered very strong orders in the first quarter and built up a nice backlog.
These wins included a new ATM-as-a-Service contract with Bank99 in Austria, valued at more than $20 million in a branch transformation win, valued at more than $13 million with a large Saudi Arabian financial institution.
Moving to Slide 10.
First-quarter revenue of $311 million was in line with our pre-COVID expectations.
Approximately $13 million of the revenue decline was due to our divestiture activity, while $8 million was due to our delivered actions taken in 2019 to reduce low-margin business.
Additionally, certain large hardware installations benefited 2019 revenue, which did not continue in 2020.
Delays from the COVID-19 pandemic pushed approximately $14 million of revenue into future periods.
Non-GAAP gross profit of $90 million in the quarter and a gross margin of 28.9% reflects the resiliency of this segment as we benefit from our DN Now services modernization and software excellence initiatives, as well as our intentional actions to reduce low-margin business.
First-quarter gross profit includes a foreign currency headwind of approximately $4 million versus the prior-year period.
On Slide 11, Americas Banking revenue of $345 million reflects a 3% decline, primarily due to our constant decision to exit lower margin service contracts.
Within our products revenue, we are seeing good growth from U.S. regional financial institutions, although nonrecurring projects at large banks in North America eased year over year as we had expected.
During the quarter, we were especially pleased to generate software revenue growth of 13% in constant currency.
Gross profit of $104 million for the quarter increased 30% versus the prior year due to the execution of our DN Now initiatives and a favorable customer mix.
We were pleased to expand gross margins from 22.7% to 30.3%, with meaningful contributions from all three business lines.
Key to our success was services gross margin of 32.1% for this segment, reflecting very good performance from our services modernization initiative.
Slide 12 contains financial highlights for our retail segment.
From an orders perspective, retail performed as we expected and was in line with the prior-year period.
Revenue of $256 million primarily reflects lower POS installation activity in Europe, partially offset by growth in self-checkout hardware and higher software activity.
Both results came in as expected.
The impact of the pandemic was more acute in this segment, pushing approximately $19 million of revenue out of the quarter.
Gross profit increased to $60 million, up 11% in the quarter, and gross margin improved significantly to 23.4% due to a favorable revenue mix from services software and self-checkout solutions, as well as solid progress with our services modernization and software excellence program.
Our cash flow update is on Slide 13.
As we discussed previously, the company has been consistent and are disciplined in managing our net working capital over the past several quarters.
Net working capital as a percentage of trailing 12-month revenue declined steadily over the last seven quarters, down to 13.3% in the first quarter of 2020, down from 19.1% a year ago, due primarily to more efficient management of inventory and accounts payable.
From a cash flow perspective, net working capital drove a $15 million benefit year over year.
Because of our focus, we believe the company is well prepared to manage net working capital during the current challenging economic conditions.
As communicated previously, the company typically uses cash during the first half of the year and our free cash use of $65 million in the quarter was slightly better than our expectations and slightly improved versus one year ago.
First-quarter results include an incremental $35 million of compensation-related cash payments tied to our strong 2019 performance.
Adjusting for this item, you can clearly see that we are delivering high-quality earnings in addition to our net working capital efficiencies.
Towards the bottom of the slide, we bridge our cash balances from the end of 2019 through the end of March.
We used approximately $71 million to pay down debt.
This includes our amortization payments, as well as our contractual requirement to reduce debt with at least half of our free cash flow from the prior year.
Since I have already discussed our free cash flow, the next item is cash inflow from our revolving credit facility.
We drew the entire available amount from our facility in March out of an abundance of caution in light of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic and related macroeconomic implications.
This action has almost no impact on our expected cash interest payments of approximately $170 million because the incremental interest on the revolver will largely be offset by lower LIBOR rates for other debt instruments.
An additional $89 million reduction of cash is attributed to foreign currency headwinds experienced in the quarter, plus the effect of selling our 68% stake in the German IT outsourcing business called, Portavis and one other pending transaction.
With a cash balance of $549 million at the end of March, we believe we have adequate liquidity to fund the seasonal cash flows of our business and our DN Now transformation program.
On Slide 14, we highlight our debt maturities and leverage ratio.
Our contractual debt maturities of $98 million for 2020 and $26 million for 2021 are manageable under our current liquidity model.
We continue to monitor the debt markets relative to our strategy to address our 2022 debt maturities.
At the appropriate time, we will take steps to optimize our capital structure by reducing our weighted average cost of capital, lowering interest rates and extending maturities.
To the right of the slide, we have provided our net debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA ratio for the past five quarters.
As you can see, we have steadily improved this metric and we are pleased to maintain the 4.4 times ratio in the first quarter as our adjusted EBITDA gains offset the changes to net debt.
This compares favorably to our bank covenant maximum of 7 times.
Our net debt on 31st March was approximately $1.9 billion.
Moving to Slide 15.
I will build upon Gerrard's comments about the financial resiliency of our business model and provide a few guideposts for understanding how we expect to perform under challenging macroeconomic conditions.
For your convenience, we have provided selected financial results from 2019, including revenue and gross margin for services, products and software.
We expect our services business to be resilient during this time, with a mild impact to revenue.
As previously disclosed, we expect to complete two divestitures in 2020, which generated about $110 million of services revenue for the company in 2019.
One of these transactions closed in Q1, with the other expected to close in Q2, subject to customary closing conditions.
Additionally, the software we deliver for our customers is critical to their performance, and therefore, we expect a mild impact for COVID-19 to this business line.
With respect to product revenue, we expect a moderate impact based on what we have seen thus far, as well as the company's experience from prior recessions.
Given the timing of the crisis, it is reasonable to expect a more significant impact of product revenue in the second quarter as certain product installations are expected to be delayed during country lockdowns while other hardware orders are postponed.
Our current cost structure and incremental action plans provide us with the confidence to improve gross margins during this challenging time.
We are targeting improvements to service margins due to our actions to improve the quality of revenue and execution of the services modernization plan.
For products, we expect to deliver broadly stable gross margin due to our variable cost structure and our solid performance in the first quarter, inclusive of some level of higher freight costs.
At the same time, we expect to improve our software margins versus the prior year due to better project execution and more efficient utilization of labor.
Moving to operating profit.
We expect to benefit from our DN Now initiatives and our plans for realizing approximately $130 million of savings for 2020.
And while COVID-19 is having a mild influence on select DN Now work streams, we have also launched incremental actions to generate $80 million to $100 million of savings, as Gerrard described.
These actions include: accelerating our finance transformation, streamlining indirect spend, significantly lower bonus expense and other labor savings, reduced travel and marketing expenditures and savings from our real estate and information technology initiatives.
Together with our net working capital efficiencies and cash management actions, we are targeting breakeven free cash flow for 2020.
By minimizing the uses of cash, we will maintain adequate liquidity and covenant compliance through 2020.
In summary, this leadership team has taken significant and appropriate action to strengthen the company during these challenging times.
Our accomplishment, near-term plans and company values provide us with the confidence to persevere.
We are hard at work executing these plans, and we are developing additional levers to be used as needed.
And now I will hand the call back to Gerrard for closing comments.
I'd like to conclude on Slide 16 with a few reminders about why we believe Diebold Nixdorf is well-positioned to persevere through this crisis and emerge as a stronger company.
I'll also provide a few color comments regarding April.
First, we've been designated as an essential service provider to financial institutions and retailers.
Our customers are counting on us to keep their businesses running.
And during this crisis, the criticality of the ATM channel, point-of-sale and self-checkout channels have been reaffirmed strongly.
Next, our position as a trusted technology partner produces strong recurring revenue streams, which underpins a resilient business model.
Furthermore, our leadership team has demonstrated resiliency and an ability to execute complex transformation initiatives over the past two years.
Considering DN's operational rigor and our incremental cost actions in place, we are confident in our ability to navigate the current environment and emerge as a strong company.
Before we turn over to Q&A, let me offer a few thoughts on what we saw in April.
From an order entry perspective, we are seeing a moderate slowing in hardware decisions from customers in Eurasia Banking and retail, where projects are being delayed and not canceled.
Within Eurasia banking, these delays tend to be mostly evident within smaller Tier 2 banks.
Within Americas Banking, order activity has remained largely in line with our pre-COVID expectations.
Regarding installations, we have seen some hardware installations push out, typically by several weeks as customers focus on other priorities.
In April, our factories shipped more volume than in the same period of 2019, reflecting the backlog as we entered Q2, even though we may see some implementations pushed out of Q2.
From a services perspective, we continue to be fully engaged with customers in delivering strong service levels.
And from a software perspective, we've not seen any delays in professional services projects from larger customers, but the only delays observed among Tier 2 and Tier 3 customers.
Overall, employee morale remains strong as we rally around our customers' needs and implement incremental actions to strengthen Diebold Nixdorf.
In closing, while the current operating environment is dynamic, we remain confident in our people, our mission and in the resiliency of our business.
We stand ready to support our customers as the global economic economy recovers.
Our confidence is based on the DN Now foundation we've built over the last two years, the robust plans we're executing and the tremendous response we're seeing from Diebold Nixdorf employees who are living out at company values.

We are pleased to report our first quarter results, which reflect strong progress against our DN Now transformation plan.
We delivered on our top-line guidance, and we improved gross margins by 380 basis points versus the prior year.
Our first-quarter results also include the benefit of a $7 million reduction in our annual bonus expense.
These results reflect the resiliency of our business model, the effectiveness of our transformation initiatives and the decisive actions we've taken to strengthen Diebold Nixdorf during this crisis.
Our transformation plan is designed to deliver sustainable improvements in gross margins, operating expense and free cash flow.
The plan is also expected to generate $130 million of savings in 2020, which we believe will be more than sufficient to cover the impact of COVID-19.
As we discussed in March, we expect to see a mild impact to revenue and a moderate impact to profitability.
We have seen early signs of this impact in the first quarter, and we expect to see a more pronounced impact in the second quarter.
In the first quarter, we experienced a $33 million revenue decline due to the impact of COVID-19.
We have seen a $14 million decline in revenue from the banking segment and a $19 million decline from retail.
These declines are primarily due to the timing of hardware installations, as well as postponements of hardware orders.
As we look to the second quarter, we expect a more significant impact to revenue as we have seen in the first quarter.
We also expect to see an impact to profitability as we have seen in the first quarter.
We expect to deliver high-quality earnings and gross margin expansion in the second quarter, which will be partially offset by the impact of COVID-19.
In the second quarter, we expect to see a decline in hardware installations and hardware orders.
We expect to see a decline in services revenue due to a reduction in nonrecurring service contracts.
We expect to see a decline in software revenue due to the timing of projects and professional services.
We expect to see a decline in gross margin due to the mix of lower-margin hardware and services revenue.
We expect to see a decline in operating profit due to the decline in gross profit, as well as the impact of the $7 million reduction in our annual bonus expense.
We expect to deliver high-quality earnings, gross margin expansion and free cash flow improvement in the second quarter.
We are confident in our ability to deliver high-quality earnings and gross margin expansion in the second quarter, which will be partially offset by the impact of COVID-19.

For additional information, we ask that you refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Information regarding these non-GAAP measures, as well as a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP financial information is available on our website.
With that, let me turn things over to AAM's Chairman and CEO, David Dauch.
Joining me on the call today are Mike Simonte, AAM's President; and Chris May, AAM's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
To begin my comments today, I'll review the highlights of our second quarter 2021 financial results.
Next, I'll touch on some exciting business development news in the quarter, including announcements with the Chinese EV OEM deal and our recent communication about GM's Oshawa plant.
And lastly, we'll discuss the ongoing and unprecedented challenges within the supply chain and our financial outlook.
After Chris covered the details of our financial results, we will then open up the call for any questions that you may have.
AAM delivered strong operating performance in the second quarter of 2021 navigating industry production volatility stemming from the continuity of supply challenges.
These challenges were greater than we originally anticipated at the beginning of the quarter, but our team did an excellent job in managing these obstacles resulting in solid financial results.
AAM sales for the second quarter 2021, were $1.28 billion, up approximately 149% compared to $515 million in the second quarter of 2020.
The increase in our revenues on a year-over-year basis primarily reflects the recovery from COVID-19 related industry shutdowns that we experienced last year.
North American industry production was up approximately 130% according to third party estimates.
Light truck production was up 150% year-over-year.
And volumes of our core platforms increased significantly year-over-year.
Inventory levels on key light truck programs that we support remain well below normal levels.
Consumer demand for light trucks remains robust and our OEM customers are building them as fast as possible.
We believe the demand environment for these products, combined with the lack of inventory should lead to an extended recovery through 2022 which will certainly benefit AAM.
AAM's adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter 2021 was $222.6 million or 17.3% of sales.
This compares to a loss of $52.1 million last year.
In addition to benefiting from higher production levels, our intense focus on optimizing the business and flexing our cost structure over the past several quarters greatly contributed to our performance in the quarter.
We remain committed to driving efficiency and managing factors underneath our control.
AAM's adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter of 2021 was $0.29 per share compared to a loss of $1.79 in the second quarter of 2020.
And as for cash, I'm very excited about our cash flow generation in the quarter.
We generated adjusted free cash flow of over $136 million compared to an outflow of approximately $162 million in the second quarter of 2020.
Our operating performance and commitment to efficient capital spending drove this high level of free cash flow.
Additionally, we prepaid over $140 million of term loans in the second quarter.
And since the fourth quarter of 2020, to the second quarter 2021, we have paid down approximately $360 million of long-term debt.
As we previously stated, we are committed to reducing our debt and strengthen our balance sheet this year.
We are delivering on that goal.
We achieved 2.5 times net leverage ratio in the second quarter.
It is this management team's focus to further strengthen AAM's balance sheet.
On the business front, we are very excited to announce that we will be supplying electric vehicle components to NIO, supporting their next generation of e-Powertrain program.
And for those of you who don't know who NIO is, NIO is a leading Chinese electric vehicle OEM and a pioneer in China’s electric vehicle market.
We continue to see good growth opportunities to support electric vehicles with drive units and a wide range of sub-assemblies and components.
This applies with both existing and new customers.
Today's announcement clearly underscores AAM’s technology in electric vehicle propulsion and our commitment to excellence within this space.
We are very eager to support this new customer.
Electrification dialog with multiple global OEMs continues to be very constructive as manufacturers are intensely focused to support this transformation.
We see plenty of opportunities over the next several years as our state-of-the-art technology, engineering, compact design and new product offerings are attracting strong global interest.
Our engineering teams are rapidly developing next-generation technology, while supporting the launch of multiple new electrification programs globally.
Our technology, innovation, and focus on customer service, our strong value propositions, allowing OEMs to compete to win business with both traditional and start up OEMs. It's our goal to be the supplier of choice when it comes to the electric drive units, sub-assemblies and components.
Clearly, these are very exciting times for AAM.
Having said that, we continue to deliver on our theme of securing the future by protecting the core.
We are very pleased to reiterate that AAM will be the sole supplier of front, rear pick-up axles for the production at GM's Oshawa facility.
This development demonstrates our high quality products and on-time delivery capabilities, as well as our strong relationship with General Motors.
We look forward to supporting GM as they expand their production of the successful full-sized trucks to meet consumer demand and rebuild their inventories.
In the quarter, we completed an acquisition which specializes in producing powdered metal components.
And as we mentioned before, we will do smart, quick-return, bolt-on acquisitions that will complement our core business, drive synergies, and provide solid financial returns.
This was a compelling high value purchase which should immediately benefit AAM as also part of our long-term lightweighting component strategy.
Finally, we are recognized as GM overdrive award winner in 2020.
We are very grateful for this award as it demonstrates our commitment to the continuity of supply, while addressing an unfortunate industrial fire last year.
Operational excellence is a core value for AAM and will certainly benefit us and provide us the competitive advantage going forward.
Before I transition to Chris, I want to talk about our current operating environment and our financial guidance.
The stress on the value chain stemming from shortages and semiconductors, labor, steel, shipping containers, port delays, and rising commodity prices is unprecedented.
Second quarter 2021 was a challenging environment with the semiconductor challenges causing the production volatility that we saw in our schedules.
These headwinds are continuing and schedules will remain volatile.
We believe the second quarter 2021 still to be the trough of this issue and the semiconductor availability to improve in the second half of the year.
However, we expect supply chain challenges related to this and other constraints to continue into 2022.
For AAM, we will continue to work diligently with our customers and our extended supply base to protect continuity of supply and support our customers.
Let's discuss our financial guidance.
Although there is continued operating uncertainty, especially with the availability of semiconductors, we are maintaining our guidance for revenue and raising the low end of our EBITDA range.
We are also raising our adjusted free cash flow outlook.
Our guidance is as follows.
Our revenue will be $5.3 billion to $5.5 billion.
Adjusted EBITDA $875 million to $925 million.
And adjusted free cash flow of $350 million to $425 million.
Aside from the impact of the semiconductor issue and metal market challenges, operationally, our business is running very, very well.
We are focused on managing our costs and expenses, while ensuring operational and capital efficiency to optimize our business.
And as I've mentioned before, these fundamentals should support strong margin opportunities as we return to normal operating conditions.
At AAM, we have two over achieving priorities and both are equally important.
First, we're focused on the here and the now.
That means operational excellence, strong cost management, and an unwavering commitment to support our customers.
We have continued to demonstrate these qualities and manage factors that we can control, leading to strong free cash flow generation, and yes, a stronger balance sheet.
Second, we're focused on our future.
We will continue to make investments in R&D to develop the next generation of electrified products and lightweighting of components to drive profitable future growth.
Our engineering teams are developing creative solutions to offer solid value propositions to our customers.
This is demonstrated by a high interest in our electric vehicle products.
And for us, our breadth and depth in drive chains provides us with a competitive advantage in not only technology development, but also an understanding of the OEMs, what the OEMs want from the propulsion system.
Clearly these are very exciting times and the future is very bright for AAM.
And with that, let me turn things over to Chris May.
I will cover the financial details of our second quarter results with you today.
I will also refer to the earnings slide deck as part of my prepared comments.
So, let's go ahead and begin with sales.
In the second quarter of 2021 AAM sales were $1.28 billion compared to $515 million in the second quarter of 2020.
Slide seven, shows a walk of second quarter 2020 sales to second quarter 2021 sales.
First, we add back the impact of COVID-19 from second quarter of 2020 of approximately $947 million.
Then, we account for the unfavorable impact of the semiconductor shortage which we estimate to be approximately $162 million in the second quarter of 2021.
Other volume mix and pricing was negative by $99 million.
Metals and FX accounted for an increase in sales of $82 million.
During the last several quarters, we have continued to see an increase in the primary index related inputs to metal-based materials that we purchase.
You may recall, we hedged this risk with our customers by passing through the majority of index related changes.
The metal portion of this column reflects those elevated pass-throughs on a year-over-year comparison.
Now, let's move on to profitability.
Gross profit was $190 million or 14.8% of sales in the second quarter of 2021, compared to a loss of $99 million in the second quarter of 2020.
Adjusted EBITDA was $222.6 million in the second quarter of 2021 or 17.3% of sales.
This compares to a loss of $52.1 million in the second quarter of 2020.
You could see a year-over-year walk down of adjusted EBITDA on slide eight.
We benefited from the contribution margin on the increase in net sales from last year as we continued to experience positive improvements in performance.
As a result, the short notice production schedule changes and receipt of long lead inventory items such as steel, our raw, whipped, and finished goods inventories increased in this quarter.
This drove a $16 million benefit from inventory absorption timing, which should reverse out in the second half of the year as we anticipate reducing inventories during that timeframe.
As we mentioned, throughout the quarter, our schedules were more volatile than expected, but we were able to close the latter part of the quarter on a strong note.
Now, let me cover SG&A.
SG&A expense including R&D in the first quarter of 2021 was $86 million or 6.7% of sales.
This compares to 14.3% of sales in the second quarter of 2020 as revenues rapidly declined last year due to COVID-19 related shutdowns.
AAM's R&D spending in the second quarter of 2021 was $30 million compared to $32 million in the second quarter of 2020.
We will continue to focus on controlling our SG&A costs, while at the same time, continue to invest in key technologies and innovations, with an emphasis on electrification.
This emphasis includes an appropriate level of funding to be successful and meet our objectives, but also include, smartly utilizing current resources from traditional products to support new technology development in a cost effective manner.
We do expect R&D to increase in the second half of the year as we are positioning to launch and pursue more electric vehicle business.
We continue to experience significant customer interest in our new products and technology.
Now, let's move on to interest and taxes.
Net interest expense was $47.3 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $51.6 million in the second quarter of 2020.
We expect this favorable trend to continue as we benefit from continued debt reduction.
In the second quarter of 2021, we recorded income tax expense of $2.4 million compared to a benefit of $43.9 million in the second quarter of 2020.
As we continue into 2021, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 15% to 20%.
We would expect cash taxes to be in the $30 million to $40 million range.
Taking all these sales and cost drivers into account, our GAAP net income was $16 million or $0.13 per share in the second quarter of 2021, compared to a loss of $213.2 million or a loss of $1.88 per share in the second quarter of 2020.
Let's now move to cash flow and the balance sheet.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the second quarter of 2021 was $167.1 million compared to an outflow of $142.5 million last year.
Capital expenditures, net of the proceeds from the sale of property plant equipment for the second quarter of 2021 was $41 million.
Cash payments for restructuring acquisition-related activity for the second quarter of 2021 were $16 million.
The net cash inflow related to the recovery from the Malvern fire we experienced in September of 2020 was $5 million in the quarter.
However, we anticipate the Malvern fire to have a neutral cash impact for the full year as the timing of cash expenditures and cash insurance proceeds align over time.
In total, we would expect $50 million to $65 million in restructuring and acquisition costs in 2021.
This is no change from prior guidance.
Reflecting the impact of this activity, AAM generated adjusted free cash flow of $136.1 million in the second quarter of 2021.
From a debt leverage perspective, we ended the quarter with net debt of $2.6 billion and LTM adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion, calculating a net leverage ratio of 2.5 times at June 30.
This continues the trend of a declining leverage ratio and marks the achievement of a critical goal for 2021 to reduce our leverage by a full turn or more this year.
Speaking of AAM's strong free cash flow generation, we prepaid over $140 million on our term-loans in the quarter.
Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we redeemed an additional $100 million on our 6.25% notes due in 2025.
We continue to expect to strengthen AAM's balance sheet by reducing our gross debt and lowering future interest payments.
As of today, we have paid down approximately $350 million in our term loans and notes in 2021 alone.
Before we move on to the Q&A portion of the call, let me close out my comments with some thoughts on our 2021 financial outlook.
We raised the lower end of our adjusted EBITDA range and we increased our outlook for adjusted free cash flow.
Our outlook is based on the latest and best information we have regarding our customer production schedules, including the reduction in GM truck production we are experiencing this week.
We continue to assume our customers will prioritize building full-size pickup trucks and SUVs is going forward.
But the uncertain backdrop related to semiconductors remains, thus the ranges we have provided.
The revision to our free cash flow range is a result of focused and efficient capital spending, restructuring and cost reduction initiatives, year-over-year margin growth and working capital optimization.
Our strong financial results will be used to reduce debt and support our research and development initiatives to solidify our position for future profitable growth AAM continues to focus on building long-term shareholder value and success.
We are focused on our future in electrification.
We continue to allocate more engineering and financial resources to technology development to provide compelling high value products to OEMs and drive our future profitable growth.
You are now beginning to see tangible results with the new business award announcements we are making.
We will continue to secure business on our legacy core platforms that will yield strong cash flows well into the future.
And let's not forget our passion to run an efficient highly focused organization that centers around performance optimization, strong cost structure, and the delivery of best-in-class results.
The second quarter of 2021 continues a theme of managing factors under our control in a difficult operating environment.
There are plenty of near-term challenges and uncertainties as it relates to the supply chain in the second half of 2021.
But that stated, this management team is experienced and confident in navigating these obstacles.
We have reserved some time to take questions.
So, at this time, please feel free to proceed with any questions you may have.

With that, let me turn things over to AAM's Chairman and CEO, David Dauch.
Joining me on the call today are Mike Simonte, AAM's President; and Chris May, AAM's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
To begin my comments today, I'll review the highlights of our second quarter 2021 financial results.
Next, I'll touch on some exciting business development news in the quarter, including announcements with the Chinese EV OEM deal and our recent communication about GM's Oshawa plant.
And lastly, we'll discuss the ongoing and unprecedented challenges within the supply chain and our financial outlook.
After Chris covered the details of our financial results, we will then open up the call for any questions that you may have.
AAM delivered strong operating performance in the second quarter of 2021 navigating industry production volatility stemming from the continuity of supply challenges.
These challenges were greater than we originally anticipated at the beginning of the quarter, but our team did an excellent job in managing these obstacles resulting in solid financial results.
AAM sales for the second quarter 2021, were $1.28 billion, up approximately 149% compared to $515 million in the second quarter of 2020.
The increase in our revenues on a year-over-year basis primarily reflects the recovery from COVID-19 related industry shutdowns that we experienced last year.
North American industry production was up approximately 130% according to third party estimates.
Light truck production was up 150% year-over-year.
And volumes of our core platforms increased significantly year-over-year.
Inventory levels on key light truck programs that we support remain well below normal levels.
Consumer demand for light trucks remains robust and our OEM customers are building them as fast as possible.
We believe the demand environment for these products, combined with the lack of inventory should lead to an extended recovery through 2022 which will certainly benefit AAM.
AAM's adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter 2021 was $222.6 million or 17.3% of sales.
This compares to a loss of $52.1 million last year.
In addition to benefiting from higher production levels, our intense focus on optimizing the business and flexing our cost structure over the past several quarters greatly contributed to our performance in the quarter.
We remain committed to driving efficiency and managing factors underneath our control.
AAM's adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter of 2021 was $0.29 per share compared to a loss of $1.79 in the second quarter of 2020.
And as for cash, I'm very excited about our cash flow generation in the quarter.
We generated adjusted free cash flow of over $136 million compared to an outflow of approximately $162 million in the second quarter of 2020.
Our operating performance and commitment to efficient capital spending drove this high level of free cash flow.
Additionally, we prepaid over $140 million of term loans in the second quarter.
And since the fourth quarter of 2020, to the second quarter 2021, we have paid down approximately $360 million of long-term debt.
As we previously stated, we are committed to reducing our debt and strengthen our balance sheet this year.
We are delivering on that goal.
We achieved 2.5 times net leverage ratio in the second quarter.
It is this management team's focus to further strengthen AAM's balance sheet.
On the business front, we are very excited to announce that we will be supplying electric vehicle components to NIO, supporting their next generation of e-Powertrain program.
And for those of you who don't know who NIO is, NIO is a leading Chinese electric vehicle OEM and a pioneer in China’s electric vehicle market.
We continue to see good growth opportunities to support electric vehicles with drive units and a wide range of sub-assemblies and components.
This applies with both existing and new customers.
Today's announcement clearly underscores AAM’s technology in electric vehicle propulsion and our commitment to excellence within this space.
We are very eager to support this new customer.
Electrification dialog with multiple global OEMs continues to be very constructive as manufacturers are intensely focused to support this transformation.
We see plenty of opportunities over the next several years as our state-of-the-art technology, engineering, compact design and new product offerings are attracting strong global interest.
Our engineering teams are rapidly developing next-generation technology, while supporting the launch of multiple new electrification programs globally.
Our technology, innovation, and focus on customer service, our strong value propositions, allowing OEMs to compete to win business with both traditional and start up OEMs. It's our goal to be the supplier of choice when it comes to the electric drive units, sub-assemblies and components.
Clearly, these are very exciting times for AAM.
Having said that, we continue to deliver on our theme of securing the future by protecting the core.
We are very pleased to reiterate that AAM will be the sole supplier of front, rear pick-up axles for the production at GM's Oshawa facility.
This development demonstrates our high quality products and on-time delivery capabilities, as well as our strong relationship with General Motors.
We look forward to supporting GM as they expand their production of the successful full-sized trucks to meet consumer demand and rebuild their inventories.
In the quarter, we completed an acquisition which specializes in producing powdered metal components.
And as we mentioned before, we will do smart, quick-return, bolt-on acquisitions that will complement our core business, drive synergies, and provide solid financial returns.
This was a compelling high value purchase which should immediately benefit AAM as also part of our long-term lightweighting component strategy.
Finally, we are recognized as GM overdrive award winner in 2020.
We are very grateful for this award as it demonstrates our commitment to the continuity of supply, while addressing an unfortunate industrial fire last year.
Operational excellence is a core value for AAM and will certainly benefit us and provide us the competitive advantage going forward.
Before I transition to Chris, I want to talk about our current operating environment and our financial guidance.
The stress on the value chain stemming from shortages and semiconductors, labor, steel, shipping containers, port delays, and rising commodity prices is unprecedented.
Second quarter 2021 was a challenging environment with the semiconductor challenges causing the production volatility that we saw in our schedules.
These headwinds are continuing and schedules will remain volatile.
We believe the second quarter 2021 still to be the trough of this issue and the semiconductor availability to improve in the second half of the year.
However, we expect supply chain challenges related to this and other constraints to continue into 2022.
For AAM, we will continue to work diligently with our customers and our extended supply base to protect continuity of supply and support our customers.
Let's discuss our financial guidance.
Although there is continued operating uncertainty, especially with the availability of semiconductors, we are maintaining our guidance for revenue and raising the low end of our EBITDA range.
We are also raising our adjusted free cash flow outlook.
Our guidance is as follows.
Our revenue will be $5.3 billion to $5.5 billion.
Adjusted EBITDA $875 million to $925 million.
And adjusted free cash flow of $350 million to $425 million.
Aside from the impact of the semiconductor issue and metal market challenges, operationally, our business is running very, very well.
We are focused on managing our costs and expenses, while ensuring operational and capital efficiency to optimize our business.
And as I've mentioned before, these fundamentals should support strong margin opportunities as we return to normal operating conditions.
At AAM, we have two over achieving priorities and both are equally important.
First, we're focused on the here and the now.
That means operational excellence, strong cost management, and an unwavering commitment to support our customers.
We have continued to demonstrate these qualities and manage factors that we can control, leading to strong free cash flow generation, and yes, a stronger balance sheet.
Second, we're focused on our future.
We will continue to make investments in R&D to develop the next generation of electrified products and lightweighting of components to drive profitable future growth.
Our engineering teams are developing creative solutions to offer solid value propositions to our customers.
This is demonstrated by a high interest in our electric vehicle products.
And for us, our breadth and depth in drive chains provides us with a competitive advantage in not only technology development, but also an understanding of the OEMs, what the OEMs want from the propulsion system.
Clearly these are very exciting times and the future is very bright for AAM.
And with that, let me turn things over to Chris May.
I will cover the financial details of our second quarter results with you today.
I will also refer to the earnings slide deck as part of my prepared comments.
So, let's go ahead and begin with sales.
In the second quarter of 2021 AAM sales were $1.28 billion compared to $515 million in the second quarter of 2020.
Slide seven, shows a walk of second quarter 2020 sales to second quarter 2021 sales.
First, we add back the impact of COVID-19 from second quarter of 2020 of approximately $947 million.
Then, we account for the unfavorable impact of the semiconductor shortage which we estimate to be approximately $162 million in the second quarter of 2021.
Other volume mix and pricing was negative by $99 million.
Metals and FX accounted for an increase in sales of $82 million.
During the last several quarters, we have continued to see an increase in the primary index related inputs to metal-based materials that we purchase.
You may recall, we hedged this risk with our customers by passing through the majority of index related changes.
The metal portion of this column reflects those elevated pass-throughs on a year-over-year comparison.
Now, let's move on to profitability.
Gross profit was $190 million or 14.8% of sales in the second quarter of 2021, compared to a loss of $99 million in the second quarter of 2020.
Adjusted EBITDA was $222.6 million in the second quarter of 2021 or 17.3% of sales.
This compares to a loss of $52.1 million in the second quarter of 2020.
You could see a year-over-year walk down of adjusted EBITDA on slide eight.
We benefited from the contribution margin on the increase in net sales from last year as we continued to experience positive improvements in performance.
As a result, the short notice production schedule changes and receipt of long lead inventory items such as steel, our raw, whipped, and finished goods inventories increased in this quarter.
This drove a $16 million benefit from inventory absorption timing, which should reverse out in the second half of the year as we anticipate reducing inventories during that timeframe.
As we mentioned, throughout the quarter, our schedules were more volatile than expected, but we were able to close the latter part of the quarter on a strong note.
Now, let me cover SG&A.
SG&A expense including R&D in the first quarter of 2021 was $86 million or 6.7% of sales.
This compares to 14.3% of sales in the second quarter of 2020 as revenues rapidly declined last year due to COVID-19 related shutdowns.
AAM's R&D spending in the second quarter of 2021 was $30 million compared to $32 million in the second quarter of 2020.
We will continue to focus on controlling our SG&A costs, while at the same time, continue to invest in key technologies and innovations, with an emphasis on electrification.
This emphasis includes an appropriate level of funding to be successful and meet our objectives, but also include, smartly utilizing current resources from traditional products to support new technology development in a cost effective manner.
We do expect R&D to increase in the second half of the year as we are positioning to launch and pursue more electric vehicle business.
We continue to experience significant customer interest in our new products and technology.
Now, let's move on to interest and taxes.
Net interest expense was $47.3 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $51.6 million in the second quarter of 2020.
We expect this favorable trend to continue as we benefit from continued debt reduction.
In the second quarter of 2021, we recorded income tax expense of $2.4 million compared to a benefit of $43.9 million in the second quarter of 2020.
As we continue into 2021, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 15% to 20%.
We would expect cash taxes to be in the $30 million to $40 million range.
Taking all these sales and cost drivers into account, our GAAP net income was $16 million or $0.13 per share in the second quarter of 2021, compared to a loss of $213.2 million or a loss of $1.88 per share in the second quarter of 2020.
Let's now move to cash flow and the balance sheet.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the second quarter of 2021 was $167.1 million compared to an outflow of $142.5 million last year.
Capital expenditures, net of the proceeds from the sale of property plant equipment for the second quarter of 2021 was $41 million.
Cash payments for restructuring acquisition-related activity for the second quarter of 2021 were $16 million.
The net cash inflow related to the recovery from the Malvern fire we experienced in September of 2020 was $5 million in the quarter.
However, we anticipate the Malvern fire to have a neutral cash impact for the full year as the timing of cash expenditures and cash insurance proceeds align over time.
In total, we would expect $50 million to $65 million in restructuring and acquisition costs in 2021.
This is no change from prior guidance.
Reflecting the impact of this activity, AAM generated adjusted free cash flow of $136.1 million in the second quarter of 2021.
From a debt leverage perspective, we ended the quarter with net debt of $2.6 billion and LTM adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion, calculating a net leverage ratio of 2.5 times at June 30.
This continues the trend of a declining leverage ratio and marks the achievement of a critical goal for 2021 to reduce our leverage by a full turn or more this year.
Speaking of AAM's strong free cash flow generation, we prepaid over $140 million on our term-loans in the quarter.
Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we redeemed an additional $100 million on our 6.25% notes due in 2025.
We continue to expect to strengthen AAM's balance sheet by reducing our gross debt and lowering future interest payments.
As of today, we have paid down approximately $350 million in our term loans and notes in 2021 alone.
Before we move on to the Q&A portion of the call, let me close out my comments with some thoughts on our 2021 financial outlook.
We raised the lower end of our adjusted EBITDA range and we increased our outlook for adjusted free cash flow.
Our outlook is based on the latest and best information we have regarding our customer production schedules, including the reduction in GM truck production we are experiencing this week.
We continue to assume our customers will prioritize building full-size pickup trucks and SUVs is going forward.
But the uncertain backdrop related to semiconductors remains, thus the ranges we have provided.
The revision to our free cash flow range is a result of focused and efficient capital spending, restructuring and cost reduction initiatives, year-over-year margin growth and working capital optimization.
Our strong financial results will be used to reduce debt and support our research and development initiatives to solidify our position for future profitable growth AAM continues to focus on building long-term shareholder value and success.
We are focused on our future in electrification.
We continue to allocate more engineering and financial resources to technology development to provide compelling high value products to OEMs and drive our future profitable growth.
You are now beginning to see tangible results with the new business award announcements we are making.
We will continue to secure business on our legacy core platforms that will yield strong cash flows well into the future.
And let's not forget our passion to run an efficient highly focused organization that centers around performance optimization, strong cost structure, and the delivery of best-in-class results.
The second quarter of 2021 continues a theme of managing factors under our control in a difficult operating environment.
There are plenty of near-term challenges and uncertainties as it relates to the supply chain in the second half of 2021.
But that stated, this management team is experienced and confident in navigating these obstacles.
We have reserved some time to take questions.
So, at this time, please feel free to proceed with any questions you may have.

13,"These uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC.
We use adjusted constant dollar amounts as lead numbers in our discussion because we believe they more accurately represent the true operational performance and underlying results of our business.
You may also hear us refer to reported amounts, which are in accordance with US GAAP.
Due to the significant impact of the coronavirus pandemic on our prior year figures, today's call also contains certain comparisons to the same period in fiscal 2020 for additional context.
These comparisons are all under the reported dollar basis.
On June 28, 2021, the company completed the sale of its Occupational Workwear business.
Accordingly the company has reported the related held for sale assets and liabilities of this business as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations and included the operating results and cash flows of this business in disc ops for all periods through the date of sale.
Joining me on the call will be VF's Chairman, President and CEO, Steve Rendle; and EVP and CFO, Matt Puckett.
We are encouraged by the strong start to our fiscal 2022 year.
Our teams delivered an outstanding first quarter powering VF back to pre-pandemic revenue levels while driving an earnings recovery well ahead of our initial expectations.
We continue to see broad based momentum across the portfolio, which furthers my confidence in our ability to accelerate growth through fiscal 2022 and beyond.
While the near-term environment remains somewhat clouded by virus surges in Southeast Asia, uncertainties in other regions brought on by the impact of new variants and further pressures on the global supply chain, our teams are executing.
We remain focused on the things that we can control and winning the parts of our business with the consumers coming back strong.
And we remain confident in our ability to continue driving this sharp recovery across our business.
Matt, will walk you through our results in detail, but I'll start off with some Q1 highlights.
VF revenue has surpassed pre-pandemic levels growing 96% or 83% organically to $2.2 billion with momentum across brands, regions, and channels.
Our global DTC business delivered high single-digit growth relative to prior peak levels driven by a strong acceleration from our brick and mortar stores in the US and continued strength in our digital.
Our organic DTC digital business is now 72% above fiscal 2020 levels including the growing benefit of our omnichannel capabilities as we serve our consumers seamlessly across their choice of channel.
We've seen a sharp recovery in our wholesale business, which grew over 100% organically in Q1 approaching prior peak fiscal 2020 levels.
Strong sell-through trends and clean channel inventory levels from the past year are now translating into stronger fall '21 and spring '22 order books supporting an improving outlook for our wholesale business for this year and beyond.
We've seen a strong recovery in our gross margin, which grew 260 basis points to 56.7% in Q1.
This represents organic gross margin expansion relative to prior peak fiscal 2020 levels despite a 30 basis point headwind from a more challenging logistics and freight environment.
VF drove organic earnings growth of 133% delivering $0.27 in Q1.
essentially doubling our plan.
We're pleased to see our top line momentum and strong gross margin expansion translate into better than anticipated, SG&A leverage and earnings flow through an indication of the upside potential of our model as our recovery accelerates.
Now, turning to our brand highlights from the quarter.
The Vans brand as returned to pre-pandemic revenue levels growing 102% in Q1.
The recovery has been led by global DTC business, which drove double-digit growth relative to fiscal 2020 led by 73% growth in digital.
This DTC strength has been broad based with each region reporting positive DTC growth relative to pre-pandemic levels.
More Vans consumers have returned to in-person shopping experiences earlier than expected and we see encouraging trends in our DTC KPIs with consumers buying more frequently and spending more per purchase relative to historic levels.
In EMEA despite the continued impact of lockdowns and supply chain disruptions, the Vans business grew 125% this quarter representing 30% growth relative to fiscal 2020, with strength across all major markets as stores reopened throughout the region.
Vans APAC business grew 19% in Q1, led by 22% growth in China.
June marked a milestone for the brand in China with the stock launch of the Vans Family program while the official launch will be celebrated with the Super Brand Day on Tmall tomorrow.
We have already registered over one million new loyalty members following the initial launch bringing Global Vans Family membership to nearly 17 million consumers.
Vans kicked off it's 52 week drop calendar this quarter seeking to create a consistent, predictable, globally aligned and focused approach to drive brand energy and consumer engagement.
Seven weeks into the program, we are encouraged by the initial consumer reads and the instance sell out of several early drops.
Internally, the Vans team has increased its focus, energy, and resources around driving newness and compelling storytelling, which we believe will unlock further long-term value for the brand.
The team is on track to more formally market the Vans drop list in fiscal Q3 ahead of the fall holiday season.
We remain bullish on the set up for Vans moving through fiscal 2022 and are encouraged by the early reads from the back to school season underway.
We are raising off our full year outlook to growth of 28% to 29%, representing growth of 9% to 10% relative to fiscal 2020.
Moving on to the North Face.
Global brand revenues increased 83% representing 6% growth above pre-pandemic levels.
All regions rebounded sharply in Q1, highlighted by continued exceptional performance in EMEA, which grew 142% versus the prior year, and 58% relative to fiscal '20, despite the impact of door closures over the period.
The APAC business grew 22% in Q1, highlighted by 80% growth in digital relative to fiscal 2020 levels.
The North Face's spring sell-through rates where some of the highest in years reflecting strong progress on the brand's ability to drive 365 day relevancy.
TNF continues to drive energy in on-mountain categories with the FutureLight franchise as well as the Vectiv footwear rollout, further establishing its legitimacy in outdoor footwear.
We also see outsized growth in the casual categories such as logo wear, which grew over 100% in Q1 as consumers show strong engagement with the brand Off-Mountain.
TNF loyalty program the XPLR Pass has grown to over 7 million consumers adding nearly 300,000 new members in Q1, driven by exclusive member experiences and reaching the consumer journey.
We continue to be encouraged by the broad-based global momentum at The North Face and now expect the brand delivered 26% to 27% growth this year, representing 15% to 17% growth relative to fiscal 2020.
Alongside the significant top line recovery, we're seeing strong improvements in profitability and continue to expect mid teen profitability for TNF in fiscal 2022.
The Timberland brand delivered 63% growth in Q1 tracking ahead of plan.
We are encouraged by high-teens growth in the Americas, and 87% growth in digital relative to fiscal 2020 level.
We continue to see outsized growth from Outdoor, Apparel, and Timberland PRO each growing over 75% in the quarter.
Momentum behind core iconic product also continues with heritage styles being strong demand despite historically low inventories.
Our Timberland team remains committed to its purpose led vision highlighted by the recently announced Global Product Take-Back Program in partnership with ReCircled.
Beginning this fall US consumers will be able to return any Timberland product to a brand store to either be refurbished for resale or recycled into future products.
This program supports the brand's bold vision announced last fall for products to have a net positive impact on nature by 2030.
We are encouraged by Timberland's strong start to the year and as a result, we now expect the brand to deliver modest growth relative to fiscal 2020 surpassing pre-pandemic revenues beginning in Q2.
Dickies delivered another exceptional quarter, growing 58% in Q1, well ahead of our plan as the brand has kicked off several new campaigns and inventories become more available, we've been pleasantly surprised by the intensity of sell-through performance across all wholesale partners in the US.
This acceleration continues to be driven by both Work-Inspired Lifestyle product, which reported strong growth across all three regions as well as core work items.
Work-Inspired Lifestyle now represents about 40% global brand revenue.
Importantly, the Dickies brand has begun to deliver meaningful profitability improvements, driven by both gross margin expansion and SG&A efficiencies.
Q1 represented a strong start to our goal of returning to double-digit profit margins in the Work segment in fiscal 2022.
Following a strong Q1 performance and accelerating demand signals across channels, we are confident raising the full-year outlook for the Dickies brand to mid teen growth in fiscal 2022 representing over 25% growth relative to fiscal 2020 levels.
A quick update on Supreme we continue to be happy with the integration process.
The VF's supply chain organization continues to advance engagement with the Supreme teams with particular leverage opportunities in logistics capabilities, scale and relationships, which couldn't come in a more opportune time.
One quarter into our fiscal year, we remain confident in our outlook of $600 million and $0.25 from the brand.
Our strong results are reflection of the consistent execution, hard work and inspiring dedication of our teams around the world.
This continued passion and energy alongside the broad based nature of VF's acceleration give me great confidence in our ability to continue driving the strong recovery underway.
While the first quarter represents a small portion of our total year, we're starting off fiscal 2022 building up the great momentum which began in February of this year.
I'm really happy to update you on our strong Q1 results and revised outlook for the year.
We are encouraged by the continued broad-based momentum across our business and the set up for each of our big brands heading into the heart of our fiscal year.
Despite additional pressures throughout the global supply chain.
I remain confident in our team's ability to execute and to build on the strong earnings recovery delivered in Q1.
Let me start with an overview of the operating environment across geographic regions.
In the Americas, less than 5% of our stores were closed at the beginning of the quarter and all stores are currently operational.
The strong US consumer, easing US restrictions, and increased vaccination rates have encouraged a gradual recovery in foot traffic alongside continued strength in conversion.
Our Americas DTC business grew 84% organically in Q1, surpassing pre-pandemic levels, led by a sharper than expected recovery in our brick and mortar business.
Consumer appetite for athletic athleisure and outdoor categories remained strong benefiting our direct business as well as the performance of our key accounts.
Low inventories and strong sell-through trends continue to drive down promotional activity and improved quality of sales across the marketplace, which is resulting in stronger than expected order books for the upcoming fall and spring seasons.
Moving onto the EMEA region, while lockdown measures continue to affect economic activity our business has remained resilient.
Growing 97% organically in Q1, representing 13% growth relative to fiscal 2020.
Both wholesale and DTC channels returned to growth relative to 2020.
As continued strength from both our direct digital channel and from digital tightened partners have more than offset the impact of brick and mortar store closures.
About 60% of our EMEA stores were closed at the start of the first quarter.
As we sit here today, all of those doors have now reopened.
Consumer confidence is improving as restrictions ease and we've seen strong performance from our brick and mortar fleet following reopening.
For example, our UK business delivered triple-digit growth from open doors following 3 months of lockdown, representing growth of nearly 30%, relative to fiscal 2020.
Finally, our APAC region continues to deliver double-digit growth despite sporadic resurgence of the virus across many market.
Our China business grew 12% in Q1, which was impacted by a wholesale timing shift of revenues from Q1 into Q2.
Excluding this impact, China would have delivered mid teen growth this quarter.
We continue to see digitally led growth in the region, particularly with our tightened partners and remain confident in our ability to deliver greater than 20% growth in China in fiscal 2022.
While we remain pleased with our APAC performance to-date we are observing most Southeast Asian market facing various degrees of lockdowns and travel restrictions and while only about 5% of our stores are currently closed commercial activity has been impacted across most APAC markets outside of China and Hong Kong.
This latest wave also presents additional near-term uncertainty for our global supply chain.
In recent weeks more widespread virus outbreaks in key sourcing countries with lower levels of vaccinations have resulted in temporary factory lockdowns and manufacturing capacity constraints.
Our supply chain also continues to be impacted by port delays, equipment availability and other logistics challenges.
Essentially, every link in the supply chain has been impacted to varying degrees over the last 18 months.
And while we're not immune to this, we believe we've managed these challenges relatively better than most.
Our teams remain focused on delivering the products to satisfy increasing demand signals in the most cost effective and efficient way.
Some of the actions include using air freights, other means of expedited shipping and dual sourcing where appropriate.
While we remain confident in our ability to service our strong growth plan, there is a financial implications to these actions.
For example, we expect to spend more than $35 million in incremental expedited freight charges relative to fiscal 2020.
We view our supply chain is a key competitive advantage of VF and our teams are proving this now more than ever.
I want to echo Steve's appreciation for the supply chain teams' incredible execution over the past 18 months.
As a result of their tireless and tremendous effort, I remain confident in our ability to continue navigating this dynamic environment.
Now, moving into our Q1 financial results.
Total VF revenue increased 96% or 83% organically to $2.2 billion reaching pre-pandemic levels one quarter ahead of our initial expectations.
Our Q1 digital business is 72% above fiscal 2020 levels organically, representing a 31% two year CAGR.
We also continuously strengthened from key digital partners globally with pure play digital wholesale growth of over 70% relative to fiscal 2020.
VF total digital penetration was roughly a quarter of our Q1 revenues which represents about 2 times our penetration from the first quarter of 2020.
Gross margin expanded 260 basis points to 56.7% representing organic expansion from Q1 peak gross margin levels in fiscal 2020.
Relative to last year, the strong expansion was driven by greater full price selling partially offset by the expedited freight costs and business mix as our wholesale business rebounded sharply in the quarter.
When compared to fiscal 2020 gross margins, we generated a strong mix benefit, partially offset by the incremental air freight costs and FX.
Operating margin expanded meaningfully to 6.8% driven by the strong gross margin performance and SG&A leverage relative to the prior year.
We delivered earnings per share of $0.27 in Q1, representing 133% organic growth driven by a stronger top line and earnings flow through relative to our initial expectations.
Owing to strong broad-based performance in Q1, we are raising our full-year fiscal 2022 outlook.
Our outlook today assumes no significant changes to the environment, including increased disruption to our supply chain operations.
VF's revenue is now expected to be at least $12 billion representing at least 30% growth from fiscal 2021 and mid-teen increase relative to our prior peak revenue in fiscal 2020.
Excluding the Supreme business, our fiscal 2022 outlook implies organic growth of at least 25% representing at least 9% organic growth relative to fiscal 2020.
As Steve covered, the increase to our revenue guidance is broad based across the portfolio, the stronger outlooks for each of our top core brands and sizable increases in two of our emerging brands, Altra and SmartWool.
Specifically, the improved outlooks are supported by stronger-than-anticipated order books and the accelerating DTC trends we've observed over the past five months.
Moving down to P&L we still expect gross margin to exceed 56% despite a 20 basis point to 30 basis point headwind from additional airfreight that wasn't assumed in our initial outlook.
We now expect operating margins to be at least 13%, an improvement of over 20 basis points from our initial outlook, a signal to the upside potential of our model as their topline accelerates.
Fiscal 2022 earnings per share is now expected to be at least $3.20 including a $0.25 per share contribution from the Supreme brand representing at least 20% earnings growth relative to fiscal 2020.
We continue to expect to generate over 1 billion operating cash flow this year with planned capital expenditures of about $350 million including the impact of growth investments, as well as deferred capital spending from fiscal 2021.
As announced on June 28, we closed the sale of the Occupational Work business this quarter providing roughly $615 million of additional liquidity.
These proceeds are reflected in our fiscal 2022 outlook for total liquidity to exceed $4 billion.
We expect to exit this year with net leverage between 2.5 times and 3 times providing us meaningful near term optionality deploy excess capital moving forward.
We took bold decisive actions last year to position our brands and the enterprise with a strong recovery currently underway.
And the balanced broad based nature of this recovery, along with the continued optionality that our model provides gives me confidence in our ability to drive sustainable long-term growth moving forward.

We use adjusted constant dollar amounts as lead numbers in our discussion because we believe they more accurately represent the true operational performance and underlying results of our business.
You may also hear us refer to reported amounts, which are in accordance with US GAAP.
Due to the significant impact of the coronavirus pandemic on our prior year figures, today's call also contains certain comparisons to the same period in fiscal 2020 for additional context.
These comparisons are all under the reported dollar basis.
On June 28, 2021, the company completed the sale of its Occupational Workwear business.
Accordingly the company has reported the related held for sale assets and liabilities of this business as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations and included the operating results and cash flows of this business in disc ops for all periods through the date of sale.
Joining me on the call will be VF's Chairman, President and CEO, Steve Rendle; and EVP and CFO, Matt Puckett.
We are encouraged by the strong start to our fiscal 2022 year.
Our teams delivered an outstanding first quarter powering VF back to pre-pandemic revenue levels while driving an earnings recovery well ahead of our initial expectations.
We continue to see broad based momentum across the portfolio, which furthers my confidence in our ability to accelerate growth through fiscal 2022 and beyond.
While the near-term environment remains somewhat clouded by virus surges in Southeast Asia, uncertainties in other regions brought on by the impact of new variants and further pressures on the global supply chain, our teams are executing.
We remain focused on the things that we can control and winning the parts of our business with the consumers coming back strong.
And we remain confident in our ability to continue driving this sharp recovery across our business.
Matt, will walk you through our results in detail, but I'll start off with some Q1 highlights.
VF revenue has surpassed pre-pandemic levels growing 96% or 83% organically to $2.2 billion with momentum across brands, regions, and channels.
Our global DTC business delivered high single-digit growth relative to prior peak levels driven by a strong acceleration from our brick and mortar stores in the US and continued strength in our digital.
Our organic DTC digital business is now 72% above fiscal 2020 levels including the growing benefit of our omnichannel capabilities as we serve our consumers seamlessly across their choice of channel.
We've seen a sharp recovery in our wholesale business, which grew over 100% organically in Q1 approaching prior peak fiscal 2020 levels.
Strong sell-through trends and clean channel inventory levels from the past year are now translating into stronger fall '21 and spring '22 order books supporting an improving outlook for our wholesale business for this year and beyond.
We've seen a strong recovery in our gross margin, which grew 260 basis points to 56.7% in Q1.
This represents organic gross margin expansion relative to prior peak fiscal 2020 levels despite a 30 basis point headwind from a more challenging logistics and freight environment.
VF drove organic earnings growth of 133% delivering $0.27 in Q1.
essentially doubling our plan.
We're pleased to see our top line momentum and strong gross margin expansion translate into better than anticipated, SG&A leverage and earnings flow through an indication of the upside potential of our model as our recovery accelerates.
Now, turning to our brand highlights from the quarter.
The Vans brand as returned to pre-pandemic revenue levels growing 102% in Q1.
The recovery has been led by global DTC business, which drove double-digit growth relative to fiscal 2020 led by 73% growth in digital.
This DTC strength has been broad based with each region reporting positive DTC growth relative to pre-pandemic levels.
More Vans consumers have returned to in-person shopping experiences earlier than expected and we see encouraging trends in our DTC KPIs with consumers buying more frequently and spending more per purchase relative to historic levels.
In EMEA despite the continued impact of lockdowns and supply chain disruptions, the Vans business grew 125% this quarter representing 30% growth relative to fiscal 2020, with strength across all major markets as stores reopened throughout the region.
Vans APAC business grew 19% in Q1, led by 22% growth in China.
June marked a milestone for the brand in China with the stock launch of the Vans Family program while the official launch will be celebrated with the Super Brand Day on Tmall tomorrow.
We have already registered over one million new loyalty members following the initial launch bringing Global Vans Family membership to nearly 17 million consumers.
Vans kicked off it's 52 week drop calendar this quarter seeking to create a consistent, predictable, globally aligned and focused approach to drive brand energy and consumer engagement.
Seven weeks into the program, we are encouraged by the initial consumer reads and the instance sell out of several early drops.
Internally, the Vans team has increased its focus, energy, and resources around driving newness and compelling storytelling, which we believe will unlock further long-term value for the brand.
The team is on track to more formally market the Vans drop list in fiscal Q3 ahead of the fall holiday season.
We remain bullish on the set up for Vans moving through fiscal 2022 and are encouraged by the early reads from the back to school season underway.
We are raising off our full year outlook to growth of 28% to 29%, representing growth of 9% to 10% relative to fiscal 2020.
Moving on to the North Face.
Global brand revenues increased 83% representing 6% growth above pre-pandemic levels.
All regions rebounded sharply in Q1, highlighted by continued exceptional performance in EMEA, which grew 142% versus the prior year, and 58% relative to fiscal '20, despite the impact of door closures over the period.
The APAC business grew 22% in Q1, highlighted by 80% growth in digital relative to fiscal 2020 levels.
The North Face's spring sell-through rates where some of the highest in years reflecting strong progress on the brand's ability to drive 365 day relevancy.
TNF continues to drive energy in on-mountain categories with the FutureLight franchise as well as the Vectiv footwear rollout, further establishing its legitimacy in outdoor footwear.
We also see outsized growth in the casual categories such as logo wear, which grew over 100% in Q1 as consumers show strong engagement with the brand Off-Mountain.
TNF loyalty program the XPLR Pass has grown to over 7 million consumers adding nearly 300,000 new members in Q1, driven by exclusive member experiences and reaching the consumer journey.
We continue to be encouraged by the broad-based global momentum at The North Face and now expect the brand delivered 26% to 27% growth this year, representing 15% to 17% growth relative to fiscal 2020.
Alongside the significant top line recovery, we're seeing strong improvements in profitability and continue to expect mid teen profitability for TNF in fiscal 2022.
The Timberland brand delivered 63% growth in Q1 tracking ahead of plan.
We are encouraged by high-teens growth in the Americas, and 87% growth in digital relative to fiscal 2020 level.
We continue to see outsized growth from Outdoor, Apparel, and Timberland PRO each growing over 75% in the quarter.
Momentum behind core iconic product also continues with heritage styles being strong demand despite historically low inventories.
Our Timberland team remains committed to its purpose led vision highlighted by the recently announced Global Product Take-Back Program in partnership with ReCircled.
Beginning this fall US consumers will be able to return any Timberland product to a brand store to either be refurbished for resale or recycled into future products.
This program supports the brand's bold vision announced last fall for products to have a net positive impact on nature by 2030.
We are encouraged by Timberland's strong start to the year and as a result, we now expect the brand to deliver modest growth relative to fiscal 2020 surpassing pre-pandemic revenues beginning in Q2.
Dickies delivered another exceptional quarter, growing 58% in Q1, well ahead of our plan as the brand has kicked off several new campaigns and inventories become more available, we've been pleasantly surprised by the intensity of sell-through performance across all wholesale partners in the US.
This acceleration continues to be driven by both Work-Inspired Lifestyle product, which reported strong growth across all three regions as well as core work items.
Work-Inspired Lifestyle now represents about 40% global brand revenue.
Importantly, the Dickies brand has begun to deliver meaningful profitability improvements, driven by both gross margin expansion and SG&A efficiencies.
Q1 represented a strong start to our goal of returning to double-digit profit margins in the Work segment in fiscal 2022.
Following a strong Q1 performance and accelerating demand signals across channels, we are confident raising the full-year outlook for the Dickies brand to mid teen growth in fiscal 2022 representing over 25% growth relative to fiscal 2020 levels.
A quick update on Supreme we continue to be happy with the integration process.
The VF's supply chain organization continues to advance engagement with the Supreme teams with particular leverage opportunities in logistics capabilities, scale and relationships, which couldn't come in a more opportune time.
One quarter into our fiscal year, we remain confident in our outlook of $600 million and $0.25 from the brand.
Our strong results are reflection of the consistent execution, hard work and inspiring dedication of our teams around the world.
This continued passion and energy alongside the broad based nature of VF's acceleration give me great confidence in our ability to continue driving the strong recovery underway.
While the first quarter represents a small portion of our total year, we're starting off fiscal 2022 building up the great momentum which began in February of this year.
I'm really happy to update you on our strong Q1 results and revised outlook for the year.
We are encouraged by the continued broad-based momentum across our business and the set up for each of our big brands heading into the heart of our fiscal year.
Despite additional pressures throughout the global supply chain.
I remain confident in our team's ability to execute and to build on the strong earnings recovery delivered in Q1.
Let me start with an overview of the operating environment across geographic regions.
In the Americas, less than 5% of our stores were closed at the beginning of the quarter and all stores are currently operational.
The strong US consumer, easing US restrictions, and increased vaccination rates have encouraged a gradual recovery in foot traffic alongside continued strength in conversion.
Our Americas DTC business grew 84% organically in Q1, surpassing pre-pandemic levels, led by a sharper than expected recovery in our brick and mortar business.
Consumer appetite for athletic athleisure and outdoor categories remained strong benefiting our direct business as well as the performance of our key accounts.
Low inventories and strong sell-through trends continue to drive down promotional activity and improved quality of sales across the marketplace, which is resulting in stronger than expected order books for the upcoming fall and spring seasons.
Moving onto the EMEA region, while lockdown measures continue to affect economic activity our business has remained resilient.
Growing 97% organically in Q1, representing 13% growth relative to fiscal 2020.
Both wholesale and DTC channels returned to growth relative to 2020.
As continued strength from both our direct digital channel and from digital tightened partners have more than offset the impact of brick and mortar store closures.
About 60% of our EMEA stores were closed at the start of the first quarter.
As we sit here today, all of those doors have now reopened.
Consumer confidence is improving as restrictions ease and we've seen strong performance from our brick and mortar fleet following reopening.
For example, our UK business delivered triple-digit growth from open doors following 3 months of lockdown, representing growth of nearly 30%, relative to fiscal 2020.
Finally, our APAC region continues to deliver double-digit growth despite sporadic resurgence of the virus across many market.
Our China business grew 12% in Q1, which was impacted by a wholesale timing shift of revenues from Q1 into Q2.
Excluding this impact, China would have delivered mid teen growth this quarter.
We continue to see digitally led growth in the region, particularly with our tightened partners and remain confident in our ability to deliver greater than 20% growth in China in fiscal 2022.
While we remain pleased with our APAC performance to-date we are observing most Southeast Asian market facing various degrees of lockdowns and travel restrictions and while only about 5% of our stores are currently closed commercial activity has been impacted across most APAC markets outside of China and Hong Kong.
This latest wave also presents additional near-term uncertainty for our global supply chain.
In recent weeks more widespread virus outbreaks in key sourcing countries with lower levels of vaccinations have resulted in temporary factory lockdowns and manufacturing capacity constraints.
Our supply chain also continues to be impacted by port delays, equipment availability and other logistics challenges.
Essentially, every link in the supply chain has been impacted to varying degrees over the last 18 months.
And while we're not immune to this, we believe we've managed these challenges relatively better than most.
Our teams remain focused on delivering the products to satisfy increasing demand signals in the most cost effective and efficient way.
Some of the actions include using air freights, other means of expedited shipping and dual sourcing where appropriate.
While we remain confident in our ability to service our strong growth plan, there is a financial implications to these actions.
For example, we expect to spend more than $35 million in incremental expedited freight charges relative to fiscal 2020.
We view our supply chain is a key competitive advantage of VF and our teams are proving this now more than ever.
I want to echo Steve's appreciation for the supply chain teams' incredible execution over the past 18 months.
As a result of their tireless and tremendous effort, I remain confident in our ability to continue navigating this dynamic environment.
Now, moving into our Q1 financial results.
Total VF revenue increased 96% or 83% organically to $2.2 billion reaching pre-pandemic levels one quarter ahead of our initial expectations.
Our Q1 digital business is 72% above fiscal 2020 levels organically, representing a 31% two year CAGR.
We also continuously strengthened from key digital partners globally with pure play digital wholesale growth of over 70% relative to fiscal 2020.
VF total digital penetration was roughly a quarter of our Q1 revenues which represents about 2 times our penetration from the first quarter of 2020.
Gross margin expanded 260 basis points to 56.7% representing organic expansion from Q1 peak gross margin levels in fiscal 2020.
Relative to last year, the strong expansion was driven by greater full price selling partially offset by the expedited freight costs and business mix as our wholesale business rebounded sharply in the quarter.
When compared to fiscal 2020 gross margins, we generated a strong mix benefit, partially offset by the incremental air freight costs and FX.
Operating margin expanded meaningfully to 6.8% driven by the strong gross margin performance and SG&A leverage relative to the prior year.
We delivered earnings per share of $0.27 in Q1, representing 133% organic growth driven by a stronger top line and earnings flow through relative to our initial expectations.
Owing to strong broad-based performance in Q1, we are raising our full-year fiscal 2022 outlook.
Our outlook today assumes no significant changes to the environment, including increased disruption to our supply chain operations.
VF's revenue is now expected to be at least $12 billion representing at least 30% growth from fiscal 2021 and mid-teen increase relative to our prior peak revenue in fiscal 2020.
Excluding the Supreme business, our fiscal 2022 outlook implies organic growth of at least 25% representing at least 9% organic growth relative to fiscal 2020.
As Steve covered, the increase to our revenue guidance is broad based across the portfolio, the stronger outlooks for each of our top core brands and sizable increases in two of our emerging brands, Altra and SmartWool.
Specifically, the improved outlooks are supported by stronger-than-anticipated order books and the accelerating DTC trends we've observed over the past five months.
Moving down to P&L we still expect gross margin to exceed 56% despite a 20 basis point to 30 basis point headwind from additional airfreight that wasn't assumed in our initial outlook.
We now expect operating margins to be at least 13%, an improvement of over 20 basis points from our initial outlook, a signal to the upside potential of our model as their topline accelerates.
Fiscal 2022 earnings per share is now expected to be at least $3.20 including a $0.25 per share contribution from the Supreme brand representing at least 20% earnings growth relative to fiscal 2020.
We continue to expect to generate over 1 billion operating cash flow this year with planned capital expenditures of about $350 million including the impact of growth investments, as well as deferred capital spending from fiscal 2021.
As announced on June 28, we closed the sale of the Occupational Work business this quarter providing roughly $615 million of additional liquidity.
These proceeds are reflected in our fiscal 2022 outlook for total liquidity to exceed $4 billion.
We expect to exit this year with net leverage between 2.5 times and 3 times providing us meaningful near term optionality deploy excess capital moving forward.
We took bold decisive actions last year to position our brands and the enterprise with a strong recovery currently underway.
And the balanced broad based nature of this recovery, along with the continued optionality that our model provides gives me confidence in our ability to drive sustainable long-term growth moving forward.

Also, on today's conference call we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.
A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website.
We hope you and your families are all well.
Today, I will review our continued progress in executing our strategy.
Then Greg Hill will discuss our operations.
And John Rielly will then review our financial performance.
Let's begin with our strategy, which has been and continues to be to grow our resource base, have a low cost of supply and sustained cash flow growth.
By investing only in high return low cost opportunities, we've built a differentiated portfolio that is balanced between short cycle and long cycle assets.
With Guyana as our growth engine and The Bakken, Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia as our cash engines.
Guyana is positioned to become a significant cash engine as multiple phases of low cost oil development come online, which we expect will drive our portfolio breakeven Brent oil price below $40 a barrel by the middle of the decade.
As our portfolio generates increase in free cash flow, we will first prioritize debt reduction and then cash returns to shareholders through dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases.
Even as we have seen oil prices recover since the beginning of this year, our priorities continue to be to preserve cash, preserve our operating capability and preserve the long term value of our assets.
In terms to preserving cash, at the end of March, we had [Technical Issues] billion cash on the balance sheet, a $3.5 billion revolving credit facility, which is undrawn and was recently extend by one year to 2024 and no debt maturities until 2023.
We've mainted a disciplined capital on exploatory budget for 2021 of $1.9 billon.
More than 80% of this year's capital spend is allocated to Guyana, where our three sanctioned oil developments have breakeven oil price of between $25 and $35 per barrel.
And to The Bakken, where we have a large inventory of future drilling locations that generate attractive financial returns at $50 per barrel WTI.
To manage downside risk, in 2021 we have hedged a 120,000 barrels of oil per day with $55 per barrel WTI put options and 30,000 barrels of oil per day with $60 per barrel Brent put options.
To further optimize our portfolio and strengthen our cash and liquidity position, we recenly announced two asset sales.
In March, we entered into an agreement to sell our oil and gas interest in Denmark for a total consideration of $150 million effective January 1, 2021.
This transaction is expected to close in the third quarter.
On April 8, we announced the sale of our Little Knife and Murphy Creek nonstrategic acreage interest in The Bakken for a total consideration of $312 million effective March 1, 2021.
This acreage is located in the Southern most portion of Hess' Bakken position.
And [technical issues] is connected to Hess Midstream infrastructure.
The sale of this acreage, most of which we are not planning to drill before 2026, brings material value forward.
This transaction is expected to close within the next few weeks.
During the quarter, we also received $70 million in net proceeds from the public offering of a small portion of our Class A shares in Hess Midstream LP.
The Bakken remains a core part of our portfolio.
In February, as WTI oil prices moved above $50 per barrel, we added a second rig, which will allow us to sustain production and strong cash flow generation from our largest operated asset.
In terms of preserving the long term value of our assets, Guyana, with its low cost of supply and industry leading financial returns remains a top priority.
On the Stabroek Block, where Hess has a 30% interest, and ExxonMobil is the operator, we've made 18 significant discoveries to date, with gross discovered recoverable resources of approximately nine billion barrels of oil equvialent.
And we continue to see multibillion barrels of future exploration potential remaining.
We have an active exploration and appraisal program this year on the Stabroek Block.
Yesterday, we announced the discovery of the Uaru-2 Well with encouraging results that further define the large aerial extent of this accumulation, underpinning a potential future oil development.
In addition, drilling activites are under way, for appraisal at the Longtail-3 Well and for exploration at the Koeb-1 prospect.
Production from phase 1 ran at its full capacity at 120,000 gross barrels of oil per day during the first quarter.
In mid April, production was curtailed for several days after a minor leak was detected in a flash gas compressor discharge silencer.
Production has since ramped back up and is expected to remain in the range of 100,000 to 110,000 gross barrels of oil per day until repairs to the discharge silencer are completed in approximately three months.
Following this repair, production is expected to return to or above Liza Destiny's nameplate capacity of 120,000 barrels of oil per day.
The Liza Phase-II development is on track to achieve first oil in early 2022 with a capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day.
Our third oil development on the Stabroek Block, at the Payara field, is expected to achieve first oil in 2024, also with a capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day.
And we're nearing work for Yellowtail, a fourth development on the Stabroek Block is under way with anticipated start-up in 2025, pending government approvals and project sanctioning.
We continue to see the potential for at least 6 FPSOs, on the block by 2027 and longer term for up to 10 FPSOs to develop the discovered resources on the block.
As we execute our company's strategy.
We will continue to be guided by our long-standing commitment to sustainability and are proud to be an industry leader in this area.
We support the aim of the Paris agreement and also a global ambition to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.
As part of our sustainability commitment, our Board and our senior leadership have set aggressive targets for greenhouse gas emissions reduction.
In 2020 we significantly surpassed our five-year emission reduction targets, reducing the operated Scope one and Scope two greenhouse gas emissions intensity by approximately 40% and flaring intensity by approximately 60% compared to 2014 levels.
We recently announced our new five-year emission reduction targets for 2025 which are to reduce operated Scope one and Scope two greenhouse gas emissions intensity by approximately 44% and methane emissions intensity by approximately 50% from 2017 levels.
In addition, we are investing in technological and scientific advances designed to reduce, capture and store carbon emissions, including groundbreaking work being conducted by the Salk Institute to develop plants with larger root systems, that according to the Salk Institute are capable of absorbing and storing potentially billions of tons of carbon per year from the atmosphere.
In summary, our company is executing our strategy that will deliver increasing financial returns, visible and low risk production growth, and accelerating cash flow growth well into this decade.
As we generate increasing free cash flow, we will first prioritize debt reduction.
And then the return of capital to our shareholders through dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases.
Overall, in the first quarter, we demonstrated strong execution and delivery across our portfolio.
Company wide net production averaged 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, which was in line with our guidance.
The Bakken experienced extreme weather conditions and higher NGL prices during the quarter, both of which led to lower volumes.
However, the higher NGL prices resulted in significantly higher net income and cash flows.
Bakken net production in the first quarter averaged 158,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was below our guidance of approximately 170,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Of this shortfall, approximately 8,000 barrels per day was due to the significant increase in NGL prices in the quarter.
Much of our third-party gas processing from our operated production is done under percent of proceeds or POP contracts where we charge a fixed fee for processing wet gas but take NGL barrels as payment instead of cash.
POP volumes from these contracts get reported as Hess net production.
When NGL prices increase, as they did in the first quarter, it takes fewer barrels to cover our gas processing fees, hence, our reported NGL production was reduced.
But again, the higher NGL prices resulted in significantly higher earnings and cash flow.
The other fact that effected Bakken production in the quarter was related to winter storm Yuri, which brought power outages and average wind chill temperatures of minus 34 degrees Fahrenheit for two weeks in February.
These extreme temperatures were below safe operating conditions for our crews and led to higher non-productive time on our drilling rigs, significantly higher workover backlogs and lower non-operated production.
As discussed in our January earnings call, we added a second rig in the Bakken in February.
In the first quarter, we drilled 11 wells and brought four new wells online.
In the second quarter, we expect to drill approximately 15 wells and bring approximately 10 new wells online.
And for the full year 2021, we expect to drill approximately 55 wells and to bring approximately 45 new wells online.
For the second quarter, we forecast that our Bakken net production will average approximately 155,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
And for the full year 2021, between 155,000 barrels and 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
This forecast reflects the residual weather impacts, higher NGL strip prices, the sale of our non-strategic Bakken acreage, and the planned turnaround at the Tioga Gas Plant in the third quarter.
We expect net production to build in the second half of the year and forecast 2021 exit rate of between 170,000 barrels and 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Moving to the offshore.
In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, first quarter net production averaged 56,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting strong operations following hurricane recovery in late 2020.
In the second quarter, we forecast that Gulf of Mexico net production will average approximately 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
For the full year 2021, we maintain our guidance for Gulf of Mexico net production to average approximately 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting planned maintenance downtime and natural field declines.
In the Gulf of Thailand, net production in the first quarter was 64,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day as natural gas nominations continue to increase due to strong economic growth.
Second quarter and full year 2021 net production are forecast to average approximately 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Now turning to Guyana.
Our discoveries and developments on the Stabroek Block are world-class in every respect and with Brent breakeven oil prices of between $25 and $35 per barrel represent some of the lowest project breakeven oil prices in the industry.
Production from Liza Phase-1 averaged 121,000 gross barrels of oil per day or 31,000 barrels of oil per day net to Hess in the first quarter.
As John mentioned, production at the Liza Destiny was curtailed for several days following the detection of a minor gas leak in the flash gas compressors discharge silencer on April 11.
Production is currently averaging between 110,000 and 100,000 gross barrels of oil per day, and is expected to stay in that range while repairs are made to the silencer.
Upon reinstallation and restart of the flash gas compression system, expected in approximately three months, poduction is expected to return to or above nameplate -- nameplate capacity of 120,000 barrels of oil per day.
For the second quarter, we now forecast net production to average between 20,000 barrels and 25,000 barrels of oil per day.
And our full-year 2021 net production to average approximately 30,000 barrels of oil per day.
SBM Offshore has placed an order for an upgraded flash gas compressor system, which is expected to be installed in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Production optimization work is now planned in the fourth quarter, which will further increase the Liza Destiny progression capacity.
I think it's important to note that the overall performance of the subsurface in Liza-1 has been outstanding.
We have seen very strong reservoir and well performance that has met or exceeded our expectations.
Once the flash gas compressor is replaced, we are confident that we will see a significant improvement in uptime reliability.
At Liza Phase II, the project is progressing to plan with about 90% of the overall work completed and first oil remains on track for early 2022.
The Liza Unity FPSO with a production capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day is preparing to sale from the Keppel yard in Singapore to Guyana mid year.
Our third development, Payara, is also progressing to plan with about 38% of the overall work completed.
The project will utilize the Liza Prosperity FPSO, which will have the capacity to produce up to 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day.
The FPSO Hull is complete and topsides construction activities had commenced in Singapore.
First oil remains on track for 2024.
Front-end engineering and design work continues for the fourth development on the Stabroek Block at Yellowtail.
The operator expects to submit a plan of development to the Government of Guyana in the second half of this year.
Pending government approval and project sanctioning, the Yellowtail project is expected to achieve first oil in 2025.
The Stabroek Block exploration program for the remainder of the year, will focus on both Campanian Liza-type reservoirs and on the deeper Santonian reservoirs.
In addition, key appraisal activities will be targeted in the southeast portion of the Stabroek Block to inform future developments.
In terms of drilling activity, as announced yesterday, the Uaru-2 well successfully appraised the Uaru well discovery and also made an incremental discovery in deeper intervals [Phonetic].
The well encountered approximately 120ft of high quality oil bearing sandstone reservoir and was drilled 6.8 miles from the discovery well, implying a potentially large areal extent.
The Stena DrillMax is currently appraising the Longtail discovery and additional appraisal is planned at Mako and in the Turbot area, which will help define our fifth and sixth developments on the block.
The Stena Carron has commenced exploration drilling at the Koeb-1 well and an exploration well at Whiptail is planned to spud in May.
Further exploration and appraisal activities are planned for the second half of 2021 with a total of approximately 12 wells to be drilled this year.
The Noble Tom Madden and the Noble Bob Douglas and the Noble Sam Croft, which recently joined the fleet, will be primarily focused on development drilling.
Now shifting back to production.
Company wide second quarter net production is forecast to average between 290,000 barrels and 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Full year 2021 net production is now also expected to average between 290,000 barrels and 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared to our previous forecast of approximately 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
This reduction reflects the following: approximately 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, due to lower entitlements, resulting from the increase in NGL strip prices.
Again, this will be accretive overall to earnings and cash flow.
Second factor is approximately 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was related to the sale of our interest in Denmark and non-strategic acreage in North Dakota, for which we brought full value forward.
The balance primarily reflect short term weather effects in The Bakken, from which we expect to catch back up over the course of the year and again forecast a 2021 Bakken exit rate of between 170,000 barrels and 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
In closing, our team once again demonstrated strong execution and delivery across our asset base under challenging conditions.
Our distinctive capabilities and world-class portfolio will enable us to deliver industry-leading performance and value to our shareholders for many years to come.
In my remarks today, I will compare results from the first quarter of 2021 to the fourth quarter of 2020.
We had net income of $252 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to an adjusted net loss of $176 million, which excluded an after-tax gain of $79 million from an asset sale in the fourth quarter of 2020.
E&P had net income of $308 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to an adjusted net loss of $118 million in the previous quarter.
The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted E&P results between the first quarter of 2021 and the fourth quarter of 2020 were as follows.
Higher realized crude oil, NGL, and natural gas selling prices increased earnings by $192 million.
Higher sales volumes increased earnings by $99 million.
Lower DD&A expense increased earnings by $88 million.
Lower cash costs increased earnings by $39 million.
All other items increased earnings by $8 million for an overall increase in first quarter earnings of $426 million.
Excluding the two VLCC cargo sales, our E&P sales volumes were over lifted compared with production by approximately 300,000 barrels, which improved after-tax results by approximately $10 million.
The sales from the two VLCC cargoes increased net income by approximately $70 million in the quarter.
The impact of higher NGL prices improved first quarter earnings by approximately $55 million and reduced Bakken NGL volumes received under percentage of proceeds or POP contracts by 9,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared with the fourth quarter of 2020.
The Midstream segment had net income of $75 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to $62 million in the prior quarter.
Midstream EBITDA before noncontrolling interest amounted to $225 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to $198 million in the previous quarter.
In March Hess received net proceeds of $70 million from the public offering of 3,450,000 Hess owned Class A shares in Hess Midstream.
Now turning to our financial position.
At quarter end, excluding Midstream, cash and cash equivalents were approximately $1.86 billion and our total liquidity was $5.5 billion, including available committed credit facilities.
While debt and finance lease obligations totaled $6.6 billion.
Our fully undrawn 3.5 billion revolving credit facility is now committed through May 2024 following the amendment executed earlier this month to extend the maturity date by one year.
In the first quarter of 2021, net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $815 million compared with $532 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, primarily due to higher realized selling prices.
In the first quarter, net cash provided from operating activities after changes in working capital was $591 million compared with $486 million in the prior quarter.
The sale of our Little Knife and Murphy Creek acreage in The Bakken for total consideration of $312 million is expected to close within the next few weeks and the sale of our interest in Denmark for total consideration of $150 million is expected to close in the third quarter of this year.
Now turning to guidance.
Our E&P cash costs were $9.81 per barrel of oil equivalent including Libya and $10.21 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya, in the first quarter of 2021.
We project E&P cash cost excluding Libya to be in the range of $12 to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent for the second quarter, primarily reflecting the timing of maintenance and workover spend.
Full year E&P cash costs are expected to be in the range of $11 to $12 per barrel of oil equivalent, which is up from previous full year guidance of $10.50 to 11.50 per barrel of oil equivalent, due to the impact of updated production guidance.
DD&A expense was $11.83 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya.
And $12.36 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya in the first quarter.
DD&A expense excluding Libya is forecast to be in the range of $11.50 per barrel to $12.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the second quarter.
And full-year guidance of $12 per barrel to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent is unchanged.
This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs, excluding Libya to be in the range of $23.50 per barrel to $25.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the second quarter.
And $23 per barrel to $25 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year of 2021.
Exploration expenses excluding dry hole costs are expected to be in the range of $40 million to $45 million in the second quarter.
And full-year guidance of $170 million to $180 million is unchanged.
The Midstream tariff is projected to be in the range of $260 million to $270 million for the second quarter.
And full-year guidance of $1.90 million to 1.115 million is unchanged.
E&P income tax expense excluding Libya is expected to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million for the second quarter.
And $105 million to $115 million for the full year, which is up from previous guidance of $80 million to $90 million due to higher commodity prices.
We expect non-cash option premium amortization will be approximately $65 million for the second quarter and approximately $245 million for the full year, which is up from previous guidance of $205 million, reflecting additional premiums paid to increase the strike price on our crude oil hedging contracts.
In the second quarter, we expect to sell two one million barrel cargoes from Guyana, whereas we sold three one million barrel cargoes in the first quarter and we expect to sell five one million barrel cargoes over the second half of the year.
Our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are expected to be approximately $500 million in the second quarter, and the full year guidance of approximately $1.9 billion remains unchanged.
For Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $60 million to $70 million for the second quarter and the full year guidance of $280 million to $290 million remains unchanged.
For corporate, corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million for the second quarter, and full-year guidance of $130 to $140 million is unchanged.
Interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $95 million to $100 million for the second quarter, and full-year guidance of $380 million to $390 million is unchanged.
This concludes my remarks.
We will be happy to answer any questions.

Also, on today's conference call we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.
A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website.
We hope you and your families are all well.
Today, I will review our continued progress in executing our strategy.
Then Greg Hill will discuss our operations.
And John Rielly will then review our financial performance.
Let's begin with our strategy, which has been and continues to be to grow our resource base, have a low cost of supply and sustained cash flow growth.
By investing only in high return low cost opportunities, we've built a differentiated portfolio that is balanced between short cycle and long cycle assets.
With Guyana as our growth engine and The Bakken, Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia as our cash engines.
Guyana is positioned to become a significant cash engine as multiple phases of low cost oil development come online, which we expect will drive our portfolio breakeven Brent oil price below $40 a barrel by the middle of the decade.
As our portfolio generates increase in free cash flow, we will first prioritize debt reduction and then cash returns to shareholders through dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases.
Even as we have seen oil prices recover since the beginning of this year, our priorities continue to be to preserve cash, preserve our operating capability and preserve the long term value of our assets.
In terms to preserving cash, at the end of March, we had [Technical Issues] billion cash on the balance sheet, a $3.5 billion revolving credit facility, which is undrawn and was recently extend by one year to 2024 and no debt maturities until 2023.
We've mainted a disciplined capital on exploatory budget for 2021 of $1.9 billon.
More than 80% of this year's capital spend is allocated to Guyana, where our three sanctioned oil developments have breakeven oil price of between $25 and $35 per barrel.
And to The Bakken, where we have a large inventory of future drilling locations that generate attractive financial returns at $50 per barrel WTI.
To manage downside risk, in 2021 we have hedged a 120,000 barrels of oil per day with $55 per barrel WTI put options and 30,000 barrels of oil per day with $60 per barrel Brent put options.
To further optimize our portfolio and strengthen our cash and liquidity position, we recenly announced two asset sales.
In March, we entered into an agreement to sell our oil and gas interest in Denmark for a total consideration of $150 million effective January 1, 2021.
This transaction is expected to close in the third quarter.
On April 8, we announced the sale of our Little Knife and Murphy Creek nonstrategic acreage interest in The Bakken for a total consideration of $312 million effective March 1, 2021.
This acreage is located in the Southern most portion of Hess' Bakken position.
And [technical issues] is connected to Hess Midstream infrastructure.
The sale of this acreage, most of which we are not planning to drill before 2026, brings material value forward.
This transaction is expected to close within the next few weeks.
During the quarter, we also received $70 million in net proceeds from the public offering of a small portion of our Class A shares in Hess Midstream LP.
The Bakken remains a core part of our portfolio.
In February, as WTI oil prices moved above $50 per barrel, we added a second rig, which will allow us to sustain production and strong cash flow generation from our largest operated asset.
In terms of preserving the long term value of our assets, Guyana, with its low cost of supply and industry leading financial returns remains a top priority.
On the Stabroek Block, where Hess has a 30% interest, and ExxonMobil is the operator, we've made 18 significant discoveries to date, with gross discovered recoverable resources of approximately nine billion barrels of oil equvialent.
And we continue to see multibillion barrels of future exploration potential remaining.
We have an active exploration and appraisal program this year on the Stabroek Block.
Yesterday, we announced the discovery of the Uaru-2 Well with encouraging results that further define the large aerial extent of this accumulation, underpinning a potential future oil development.
In addition, drilling activites are under way, for appraisal at the Longtail-3 Well and for exploration at the Koeb-1 prospect.
Production from phase 1 ran at its full capacity at 120,000 gross barrels of oil per day during the first quarter.
In mid April, production was curtailed for several days after a minor leak was detected in a flash gas compressor discharge silencer.
Production has since ramped back up and is expected to remain in the range of 100,000 to 110,000 gross barrels of oil per day until repairs to the discharge silencer are completed in approximately three months.
Following this repair, production is expected to return to or above Liza Destiny's nameplate capacity of 120,000 barrels of oil per day.
The Liza Phase-II development is on track to achieve first oil in early 2022 with a capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day.
Our third oil development on the Stabroek Block, at the Payara field, is expected to achieve first oil in 2024, also with a capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day.
And we're nearing work for Yellowtail, a fourth development on the Stabroek Block is under way with anticipated start-up in 2025, pending government approvals and project sanctioning.
We continue to see the potential for at least 6 FPSOs, on the block by 2027 and longer term for up to 10 FPSOs to develop the discovered resources on the block.
As we execute our company's strategy.
We will continue to be guided by our long-standing commitment to sustainability and are proud to be an industry leader in this area.
We support the aim of the Paris agreement and also a global ambition to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.
As part of our sustainability commitment, our Board and our senior leadership have set aggressive targets for greenhouse gas emissions reduction.
In 2020 we significantly surpassed our five-year emission reduction targets, reducing the operated Scope one and Scope two greenhouse gas emissions intensity by approximately 40% and flaring intensity by approximately 60% compared to 2014 levels.
We recently announced our new five-year emission reduction targets for 2025 which are to reduce operated Scope one and Scope two greenhouse gas emissions intensity by approximately 44% and methane emissions intensity by approximately 50% from 2017 levels.
In addition, we are investing in technological and scientific advances designed to reduce, capture and store carbon emissions, including groundbreaking work being conducted by the Salk Institute to develop plants with larger root systems, that according to the Salk Institute are capable of absorbing and storing potentially billions of tons of carbon per year from the atmosphere.
In summary, our company is executing our strategy that will deliver increasing financial returns, visible and low risk production growth, and accelerating cash flow growth well into this decade.
As we generate increasing free cash flow, we will first prioritize debt reduction.
And then the return of capital to our shareholders through dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases.
Overall, in the first quarter, we demonstrated strong execution and delivery across our portfolio.
Company wide net production averaged 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, which was in line with our guidance.
The Bakken experienced extreme weather conditions and higher NGL prices during the quarter, both of which led to lower volumes.
However, the higher NGL prices resulted in significantly higher net income and cash flows.
Bakken net production in the first quarter averaged 158,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was below our guidance of approximately 170,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Of this shortfall, approximately 8,000 barrels per day was due to the significant increase in NGL prices in the quarter.
Much of our third-party gas processing from our operated production is done under percent of proceeds or POP contracts where we charge a fixed fee for processing wet gas but take NGL barrels as payment instead of cash.
POP volumes from these contracts get reported as Hess net production.
When NGL prices increase, as they did in the first quarter, it takes fewer barrels to cover our gas processing fees, hence, our reported NGL production was reduced.
But again, the higher NGL prices resulted in significantly higher earnings and cash flow.
The other fact that effected Bakken production in the quarter was related to winter storm Yuri, which brought power outages and average wind chill temperatures of minus 34 degrees Fahrenheit for two weeks in February.
These extreme temperatures were below safe operating conditions for our crews and led to higher non-productive time on our drilling rigs, significantly higher workover backlogs and lower non-operated production.
As discussed in our January earnings call, we added a second rig in the Bakken in February.
In the first quarter, we drilled 11 wells and brought four new wells online.
In the second quarter, we expect to drill approximately 15 wells and bring approximately 10 new wells online.
And for the full year 2021, we expect to drill approximately 55 wells and to bring approximately 45 new wells online.
For the second quarter, we forecast that our Bakken net production will average approximately 155,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
And for the full year 2021, between 155,000 barrels and 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
This forecast reflects the residual weather impacts, higher NGL strip prices, the sale of our non-strategic Bakken acreage, and the planned turnaround at the Tioga Gas Plant in the third quarter.
We expect net production to build in the second half of the year and forecast 2021 exit rate of between 170,000 barrels and 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Moving to the offshore.
In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, first quarter net production averaged 56,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting strong operations following hurricane recovery in late 2020.
In the second quarter, we forecast that Gulf of Mexico net production will average approximately 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
For the full year 2021, we maintain our guidance for Gulf of Mexico net production to average approximately 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting planned maintenance downtime and natural field declines.
In the Gulf of Thailand, net production in the first quarter was 64,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day as natural gas nominations continue to increase due to strong economic growth.
Second quarter and full year 2021 net production are forecast to average approximately 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Now turning to Guyana.
Our discoveries and developments on the Stabroek Block are world-class in every respect and with Brent breakeven oil prices of between $25 and $35 per barrel represent some of the lowest project breakeven oil prices in the industry.
Production from Liza Phase-1 averaged 121,000 gross barrels of oil per day or 31,000 barrels of oil per day net to Hess in the first quarter.
As John mentioned, production at the Liza Destiny was curtailed for several days following the detection of a minor gas leak in the flash gas compressors discharge silencer on April 11.
Production is currently averaging between 110,000 and 100,000 gross barrels of oil per day, and is expected to stay in that range while repairs are made to the silencer.
Upon reinstallation and restart of the flash gas compression system, expected in approximately three months, poduction is expected to return to or above nameplate -- nameplate capacity of 120,000 barrels of oil per day.
For the second quarter, we now forecast net production to average between 20,000 barrels and 25,000 barrels of oil per day.
And our full-year 2021 net production to average approximately 30,000 barrels of oil per day.
SBM Offshore has placed an order for an upgraded flash gas compressor system, which is expected to be installed in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Production optimization work is now planned in the fourth quarter, which will further increase the Liza Destiny progression capacity.
I think it's important to note that the overall performance of the subsurface in Liza-1 has been outstanding.
We have seen very strong reservoir and well performance that has met or exceeded our expectations.
Once the flash gas compressor is replaced, we are confident that we will see a significant improvement in uptime reliability.
At Liza Phase II, the project is progressing to plan with about 90% of the overall work completed and first oil remains on track for early 2022.
The Liza Unity FPSO with a production capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day is preparing to sale from the Keppel yard in Singapore to Guyana mid year.
Our third development, Payara, is also progressing to plan with about 38% of the overall work completed.
The project will utilize the Liza Prosperity FPSO, which will have the capacity to produce up to 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day.
The FPSO Hull is complete and topsides construction activities had commenced in Singapore.
First oil remains on track for 2024.
Front-end engineering and design work continues for the fourth development on the Stabroek Block at Yellowtail.
The operator expects to submit a plan of development to the Government of Guyana in the second half of this year.
Pending government approval and project sanctioning, the Yellowtail project is expected to achieve first oil in 2025.
The Stabroek Block exploration program for the remainder of the year, will focus on both Campanian Liza-type reservoirs and on the deeper Santonian reservoirs.
In addition, key appraisal activities will be targeted in the southeast portion of the Stabroek Block to inform future developments.
In terms of drilling activity, as announced yesterday, the Uaru-2 well successfully appraised the Uaru well discovery and also made an incremental discovery in deeper intervals [Phonetic].
The well encountered approximately 120ft of high quality oil bearing sandstone reservoir and was drilled 6.8 miles from the discovery well, implying a potentially large areal extent.
The Stena DrillMax is currently appraising the Longtail discovery and additional appraisal is planned at Mako and in the Turbot area, which will help define our fifth and sixth developments on the block.
The Stena Carron has commenced exploration drilling at the Koeb-1 well and an exploration well at Whiptail is planned to spud in May.
Further exploration and appraisal activities are planned for the second half of 2021 with a total of approximately 12 wells to be drilled this year.
The Noble Tom Madden and the Noble Bob Douglas and the Noble Sam Croft, which recently joined the fleet, will be primarily focused on development drilling.
Now shifting back to production.
Company wide second quarter net production is forecast to average between 290,000 barrels and 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Full year 2021 net production is now also expected to average between 290,000 barrels and 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared to our previous forecast of approximately 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
This reduction reflects the following: approximately 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, due to lower entitlements, resulting from the increase in NGL strip prices.
Again, this will be accretive overall to earnings and cash flow.
Second factor is approximately 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was related to the sale of our interest in Denmark and non-strategic acreage in North Dakota, for which we brought full value forward.
The balance primarily reflect short term weather effects in The Bakken, from which we expect to catch back up over the course of the year and again forecast a 2021 Bakken exit rate of between 170,000 barrels and 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
In closing, our team once again demonstrated strong execution and delivery across our asset base under challenging conditions.
Our distinctive capabilities and world-class portfolio will enable us to deliver industry-leading performance and value to our shareholders for many years to come.
In my remarks today, I will compare results from the first quarter of 2021 to the fourth quarter of 2020.
We had net income of $252 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to an adjusted net loss of $176 million, which excluded an after-tax gain of $79 million from an asset sale in the fourth quarter of 2020.
E&P had net income of $308 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to an adjusted net loss of $118 million in the previous quarter.
The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted E&P results between the first quarter of 2021 and the fourth quarter of 2020 were as follows.
Higher realized crude oil, NGL, and natural gas selling prices increased earnings by $192 million.
Higher sales volumes increased earnings by $99 million.
Lower DD&A expense increased earnings by $88 million.
Lower cash costs increased earnings by $39 million.
All other items increased earnings by $8 million for an overall increase in first quarter earnings of $426 million.
Excluding the two VLCC cargo sales, our E&P sales volumes were over lifted compared with production by approximately 300,000 barrels, which improved after-tax results by approximately $10 million.
The sales from the two VLCC cargoes increased net income by approximately $70 million in the quarter.
The impact of higher NGL prices improved first quarter earnings by approximately $55 million and reduced Bakken NGL volumes received under percentage of proceeds or POP contracts by 9,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared with the fourth quarter of 2020.
The Midstream segment had net income of $75 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to $62 million in the prior quarter.
Midstream EBITDA before noncontrolling interest amounted to $225 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to $198 million in the previous quarter.
In March Hess received net proceeds of $70 million from the public offering of 3,450,000 Hess owned Class A shares in Hess Midstream.
Now turning to our financial position.
At quarter end, excluding Midstream, cash and cash equivalents were approximately $1.86 billion and our total liquidity was $5.5 billion, including available committed credit facilities.
While debt and finance lease obligations totaled $6.6 billion.
Our fully undrawn 3.5 billion revolving credit facility is now committed through May 2024 following the amendment executed earlier this month to extend the maturity date by one year.
In the first quarter of 2021, net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $815 million compared with $532 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, primarily due to higher realized selling prices.
In the first quarter, net cash provided from operating activities after changes in working capital was $591 million compared with $486 million in the prior quarter.
The sale of our Little Knife and Murphy Creek acreage in The Bakken for total consideration of $312 million is expected to close within the next few weeks and the sale of our interest in Denmark for total consideration of $150 million is expected to close in the third quarter of this year.
Now turning to guidance.
Our E&P cash costs were $9.81 per barrel of oil equivalent including Libya and $10.21 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya, in the first quarter of 2021.
We project E&P cash cost excluding Libya to be in the range of $12 to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent for the second quarter, primarily reflecting the timing of maintenance and workover spend.
Full year E&P cash costs are expected to be in the range of $11 to $12 per barrel of oil equivalent, which is up from previous full year guidance of $10.50 to 11.50 per barrel of oil equivalent, due to the impact of updated production guidance.
DD&A expense was $11.83 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya.
And $12.36 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya in the first quarter.
DD&A expense excluding Libya is forecast to be in the range of $11.50 per barrel to $12.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the second quarter.
And full-year guidance of $12 per barrel to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent is unchanged.
This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs, excluding Libya to be in the range of $23.50 per barrel to $25.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the second quarter.
And $23 per barrel to $25 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year of 2021.
Exploration expenses excluding dry hole costs are expected to be in the range of $40 million to $45 million in the second quarter.
And full-year guidance of $170 million to $180 million is unchanged.
The Midstream tariff is projected to be in the range of $260 million to $270 million for the second quarter.
And full-year guidance of $1.90 million to 1.115 million is unchanged.
E&P income tax expense excluding Libya is expected to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million for the second quarter.
And $105 million to $115 million for the full year, which is up from previous guidance of $80 million to $90 million due to higher commodity prices.
We expect non-cash option premium amortization will be approximately $65 million for the second quarter and approximately $245 million for the full year, which is up from previous guidance of $205 million, reflecting additional premiums paid to increase the strike price on our crude oil hedging contracts.
In the second quarter, we expect to sell two one million barrel cargoes from Guyana, whereas we sold three one million barrel cargoes in the first quarter and we expect to sell five one million barrel cargoes over the second half of the year.
Our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are expected to be approximately $500 million in the second quarter, and the full year guidance of approximately $1.9 billion remains unchanged.
For Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $60 million to $70 million for the second quarter and the full year guidance of $280 million to $290 million remains unchanged.
For corporate, corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million for the second quarter, and full-year guidance of $130 to $140 million is unchanged.
Interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $95 million to $100 million for the second quarter, and full-year guidance of $380 million to $390 million is unchanged.
This concludes my remarks.
We will be happy to answer any questions.

15,"These statements reflect the participants' expectations as of today, but actual results could be different.
Participants also expect to refer to certain adjusted financial measures during the call.
A very strong holiday season concluded an outstanding year.
Throughout fiscal '22, we accelerated our recovery from the pandemic and delivered record results for our footwear companies even as we navigated a number of acute challenges.
Despite multiple COVID variants, bottlenecks across the supply chain, labor shortages, and higher costs, we capitalized on the opportunity of a strong consumer spending environment to drive our business forward.
Our exceptional results underscore the earnings power of our business model, the solid foundation for growth we built through the strong competitive positions of our retail and branded concepts, and the successful execution of our footwear-focused strategy.
There are several key achievements that defined the year.
We grew revenue more than 35% over last year and 10% over fiscal '20.
Gross margin expansion and meaningful expense leverage drove record operating income for our footwear businesses as we achieved an operating margin above 6%.
We generated $240 million of operating cash flow, putting us in a great position to further invest in our business and return over $80 million to shareholders through share repurchases equal to 9% of outstanding shares, and we delivered record adjusted earnings per share of $7.62, an increase of more than 65% over fiscal '20.
Additional highlights include capitalizing on the accelerated shift to online spending and holding on to last year's almost 75% gain to reach almost $0.5 billion of digital sales, growing our branded wholesale business by almost $90 million versus two years ago, while improving profitability, adding new licenses and strengthening retail partnerships, and increasing store revenues over 40% from last year and nearly achieving fiscal '20 levels despite having 55 fewer stores.
Overall, our results highlight the work we've done to create and curate leading footwear brands and importantly, to strengthen our position as the leading destination for teen and youth-branded fashion footwear.
In today's channel-less world, where the consumer can truly shop anywhere, Journeys' and Schuh's growth underscores the tremendous loyalty developed with existing customers and compelling proposition offered to new customers.
Teens view us as the unparalleled fashion authority, choosing fashion-right brands and styles, validating whatever brands we're currently selling, and they are increasingly turning to our concept for their branded footwear needs.
We are not dependent on anyone brand for the majority of our revenue, but rather 10 or more brands typically constitute 80% of what we sell.
Trend-driven teens who are looking for the most current assortment of fashion footwear that is always evolving, whether they want to make a statement to stand out or want to fit in and be just like their friends, come to Journeys and Schuh to buy multiple brands and seek advice from our knowledgeable fashion advisor salespeople in our youth-focused full-service environment.
The effects from the pandemic on how consumers shop rather than harming our business was instead the catalyst to reach new heights.
Shifting now to the fourth quarter.
The work we did to have the right assortment and the right holiday marketing campaigns helped deliver Q4 results well ahead of expectations.
Consumer demand was robust, and we nonetheless believe our results would have been even stronger had we been able to maintain historic levels of inventory.
Our performance over last year's Q4 was driven by store sales and, versus two years ago, by digital and branded wholesale sales.
Q4 highlights include revenue up 14% over last year and 7% over two years ago.
Remarkably, we achieved this despite overall inventory being down almost 20% versus last year and down by one-third compared with the fourth quarter two years ago during the key holiday period.
With much more limited promotional activity, coupled with price increases, full-price selling was very strong, fueling a 300-plus basis point increase in gross margin versus last year, and a 200 basis point increase compared to two years ago, much stronger than expected.
Higher sales and this better-than-expected gross margin resulted in double-digit operating income expansion over pre-pandemic levels and record adjusted earnings per share of $3.48, an increase of more than 25% compared to last year's holiday season and 13% compared to two years ago.
From a channel perspective, the power of our omnichannel strategy was on full display in the fourth quarter as consumer appetite to shop in person, especially in the days leading up to Christmas, drove an almost 20% increase in-store sales over the year-ago period.
Strong demand in stores with many items selling as soon as they hit the store floor meant less store inventory than usual was available to service online demand.
We saw the biggest shift to in-store shopping in the U.K. as Schuh stores were open 100% of the quarter compared to roughly only a third of the days last year.
Despite the strong in-store sales in both Journeys and Schuh, we held on to almost 90% of last year's digital sales in total.
So turning now to discuss each business.
I'll start with Journeys and begin with a huge congratulations to the team on setting all-time records of sales and operating profit for the year.
Journeys' performance underscores the competitive advantages the business has built and how it has leveraged those advantages to further separate itself as the destination for branded fashion footwear for teens.
All of Journeys' Top 10 brands experienced year-over-year growth in fiscal '22 with most notching significant gains.
The current fashion cycle, which I've been describing, is shifting more into casual away from fashion athletic, plays into Journeys' strength, positioning Journeys well among its competition to deliver this assortment.
In anticipation of continued supply chain pressure, we encouraged customers to shop early and they did and the holiday season got off to a very strong start.
At this peak volume time, as the season unfolded, while traffic remained solid, conversion, which had been robust, dropped off as Journeys was not able to quickly replenish in-demand products to match outsized holiday demand.
While Journeys' talented store teams drove sales above last year's level, selling whatever was available, we believe Journeys' sales would have been meaningfully higher had we been able to get the inventory receipts we had ordered.
As a positive, tight inventory led to unprecedented levels of full-price selling with customers also willing to absorb price increases to secure desired product, driving further margin acceleration.
Finally, the Journeys team continues to live its core values of being a family with an attitude that cares, partnering during the holidays with nonprofit candidates and customers at the register for its largest national community activation, and donating $600,000 for bikes for underserved youth across the United States.
As part of this initiative, Journeys' headquarters employees built and donated 300 bikes and helmets to two Nashville elementary schools just in time for the holidays.
We were incredibly pleased with holiday results as Schuh capitalized on pent-up consumer demand and delivered Q4 constant currency revenue up more than 30% versus last year and 12% versus two years ago.
Like Journeys, Schuh's strength is its ability to deliver the fashion brands desired by its youth consumer and Schuh drove a nice growth across its diversified mix of both casual and fashion athletic footwear.
As a result of its stellar execution throughout the pandemic, navigating multiple store openings and closings, and making the most of its advanced digital capabilities, Schuh garnered improved product access being moved up a tier by a number of its high-profile brands.
This step forward in access, coupled with less severe supply chain disruptions and strong inventory management allowed Schuh to be in a better inventory position over the holidays.
U.K. customers were more comfortable shopping in person, leading to better in-store traffic, Schuh retained much of its digital gains from when stores were closed last year, resulting in a Q4 46% digital penetration.
Lastly, less promotional activity and product mix also drove strong margin gains.
Turning now to our branded side.
Our plan to reimagine Johnston & Murphy for a more casual, more comfortable, post-pandemic environment continues to prove out in the marketplace with the biggest Q4 bottom-line gain over last year of all of our businesses.
J&M continues to expand its focus from not just the products consumers need for work, but the products people desire for everyday life.
Q4's strong sell-through in boots, casual and casual athletic footwear, and equally strong performance in apparel and outerwear demonstrates just how far we've come, making J&M an attractive multi-category lifestyle brand.
This pivot has included new strategies for how and where we reach our customers.
New product story marketing campaigns have been very effective, and we've seen the most growth in our digital channel, up 14% compared to Q4 last year, and growth in our under-35 customer base, up 30% in Q4.
Much stronger demand and supply constraints pushed inventory more than 50% below pre-pandemic levels, hampering our ability to capture all of the demand during the holidays and return J&M to pre-pandemic sales.
Nevertheless, we're excited about J&M's trajectory and expect upside in the year to come.
Rounding out the discussion, momentum for Licensed Brands accelerated as the year progressed, notching impressive sales growth of 70% over last year as we successfully turned around the business and capitalized on the new capabilities we obtained with the Togast acquisition.
While supply chain disruption and excess freight costs weighed on the P&L throughout the year, we saw growing demand for both Levi's and Dockers footwear in value and full-price channels, positioning the business for improved profitability as these challenges subside, and we continue to take advantage of the white space in the marketplace.
In conclusion, our footwear-focused strategy is delivering results.
COVID provided the real opportunity to transform our business at a more rapid rate.
We are a healthier company today and delivered growth and improved earnings as a result of higher digital sales and profits, a more profitable store channel, and growing branded wholesale sales.
Our future is bright as we build upon the progress we have made.
Turning now to the current year.
Fiscal '22 had headwinds I have discussed and also some unique tailwinds, namely: healthy consumer spending in the first half due to significant government stimulus; an unusually good environment for full price selling as a result of high demand and scarcity of supply; and we benefited from some onetime gains related to rent and government relief, mostly in the U.K. With respect to fiscal '23, sales have gotten off to a much stronger start versus last year, but a slower start versus pre-pandemic, driven largely by the lower inventory level and lagging tax refunds.
We are expecting year-over-year trends to moderate as we anniversary stimulus and the lack of inventory further pressures growth early in the new year, especially in the first quarter.
Looking further into fiscal '23, we're working hard to overcome the cost pressures that are prevalent today, and we don't anticipate the factors that led to such a strong full-price selling environment to be sustained.
Tom will provide the financial details of our outlook momentarily, but we feel confident about delivering topline growth on top of a very strong fiscal '22.
Consistent with what I have outlined, we are planning the back half to be much stronger than the first half as inventory levels improve, logistics cost pressure starts to ease, and continued price actions help offset higher costs.
Fiscal '23 will also be an investment year for J&M as we advance the work on the brand's repositioning.
We expect adjusted earnings per share for fiscal '23 to be between $7 and $7.75 and believe somewhere close to the middle of the range is where the year will land.
While there are a number of variables at play, our results over what has been a very volatile past 24 months gives me great confidence in our team's ability to execute.
Finally, our ESG program will achieve an important milestone early in the year with the completion of our inaugural enterprisewide carbon footprint assessment.
Our work continues to progress with more to come when we publish a comprehensive ESG report later this spring.
Throughout fiscal '22, our employees stepped up wherever needed, and I can't overstate how critical this work was to our success.
Companies succeed like we have because of strong teams and dedicated people who help them achieve new heights.
I'm incredibly proud of what we accomplished together.
I would like to echo Mimi's remarks regarding the continued success of our key strategies and our amazing people.
With the year now behind us, we feel even more confident in our portfolio and the ability of our footwear-focused strategy to drive strong results.
Throughout the year, we saw continued strength in all our businesses, culminating in a strong Q4, which was driven by our team's ability to execute the strategies put in place.
Before I get into the details of the quarter, I want to again remind you as we have done throughout the year that we believe comparing to our pre-pandemic fiscal year '20, two years ago, typically provides the more difficult and often most meaningful assessment of our business.
However, when comparing to fiscal year '20, keep in mind how our strategy has changed our business.
E-commerce has become a larger percentage of sales along with wholesale sales for licensed brands.
These changes come with an overall lower gross margin rate due to the impact of direct shipping expenses and the expansion of our wholesale volume.
However, this should be more than offset with lower SG&A from these businesses.
While these changes are reshaping the P&L, they have a net positive impact on operating margins and an added benefit of a less capital-intensive business model.
Turning now to the specifics for the quarter.
Consolidated revenue was $728 million, up 7% compared to fiscal '20.
Journeys grew 2%, while Schuh grew 12% on a constant currency basis, and we more than tripled our licensed brands business.
As for J&M, the quarter started off strong in November, but supply chain challenges led to a significant lack of inventory, which led to J&M sales being down 12% for the quarter.
From a channel perspective, we experienced increases in both the e-com and wholesale channels.
And while we drove robust growth in the store channel, sales remained 4% below fiscal year '20, as scarcity of inventory impeded sales.
Worth noting as well is that we ended the quarter with 55 fewer stores than we had in fiscal year '20 as we optimized our store footprint.
On a year-over-year comp basis, however, total company comp-store sales were up 10% and were driven by comp sales of 6% at Journeys, 22% at Schuh, and 55% at J&M.
Finally, e-commerce sales were up 36% to fiscal '20 and accounted for 22% of total retail sales, up from 17% in fiscal year '20, while we also held on to 88% of last year's gains even while having the majority of our stores open during the quarter.
We were again very pleased with gross margins, which were up 310 basis points to last year and 200 basis points versus two years ago.
Strong full-price selling and price increases offset the channel mix impact of increased e-commerce and wholesale and increased logistics costs.
Increased logistics costs put approximately 120 basis points or $9 million of pressure on Q4 gross margin, and were the greatest drag in our branded businesses.
Journeys' and Schuh's gross margins were up 330 and 250 basis points, respectively, to fiscal year '20, driven by more full-price selling and higher footwear ASPs.
J&M's gross margin was up 420 basis points to fiscal '20, also benefiting from strong full-price selling and price increases, which also drove the release of slow-moving inventory reserves.
Finally, licensed brands' gross margin was down 190 basis points to fiscal year '20, as we experienced almost 1,000 basis points or almost $5 million of pressure from additional logistics costs, which more than offset margin improvements in the business.
Adjusted SG&A expense was 39.8%, which was 170 basis points more than fiscal '20 as deleverage from investments in marketing and higher incentive compensation more than offset leverage in occupancy and selling salaries.
As a reminder, our incentive compensation plan is based on year-over-year performance.
And comparatively speaking, we had a much lower bonus expense in fiscal year '20 Q4 than we did this year.
The other major driver of the deleverage was in marketing expense, which is due to our efforts to drive our digital footprint as well as brand awareness.
This coincided with price increases and digital marketing costs, including increased cost per click.
It's worth mentioning, last year's SG&A levels were unusually low, benefiting from 10s of millions of dollars of one-time COVID rent relief.
Regarding our rent reduction efforts for fiscal '22, we negotiated permanent reductions through 181 renewals, which achieved a 16% reduction in rent expense in North America on a straight-line basis.
This was on top of a 22% reduction for 123 renewals last year.
These renewals are for an even shorter term averaging approximately two years, compared to the three-year average we have seen in recent years.
With 45% of our fleet coming up for renewal in the next couple of years, this continues to remain a key priority.
Finally, we are pleased with our ability to leverage selling salaries, particularly in this higher cost and more difficult labor environment as we effectively utilized our workforce management tools.
Last quarter, we reported that we had identified the full amount of our $25 million to $30 million cost savings target.
A large part of these savings are from current and future reductions in store occupancy.
We will continue to focus our multiyear cost savings efforts on store channel profitability, including further efforts on reducing occupancy costs, gaining more efficiencies with selling salaries to mitigate the effects of wage pressures, and continually look for ways to further drive efficiencies, given the changing cost structure of the business.
In summary, fourth quarter adjusted operating income was $66 million, a 9.1% operating margin, compared to $59 million or 8.8% for fiscal year '20.
Versus last year, operating income improved by $2 million or 2.6%.
Again, last year's SG&A levels were unusually low, benefiting from significant COVID rent relief.
The impact of this was greatest at Journeys and in large part led to lower operating income this year despite higher sales and gross margins as Journeys anniversaried these onetime gains.
The profitability achieved during the quarter provides strong evidence of the operating margin expansion that we are continuing to see with our footwear-focused strategy as well as our ability to execute our growth algorithm.
As Mimi mentioned, for the fiscal year, we achieved north of a 6% operating margin, which was an important milestone in our long-range plan.
For the quarter, our adjusted non-GAAP tax rate was 25%, which compares favorably to the 37% last year due to the impact of the Cares Act tax provisions in the fourth quarter of fiscal year '21.
This resulted in adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.48 for the quarter, which compares to $2.76 last year and $3.09 in fiscal '20.
Turning now to the balance sheet.
Q4 total ending inventory was down 24%, compared to fiscal '20 on sales that were up 7%.
At the end of the quarter, all our business experienced inventory shortfalls versus fiscal '20 with the most impacted in Journeys and J&M, which were down 20% and 39%, respectively.
Our strong net cash position of $305 million, an increase of over $120 million versus last year, was driven by our strong operating performance.
Additionally, we consolidated operations and sold a warehouse, realizing a sizable gain on the transaction.
This strong performance and our confidence in the business enabled us to continue to return cash to our shareholders through the repurchase of 840,000 shares of stock for $52 million at an average price of $62.22 per share during the quarter.
Total fiscal '22 share repurchases were approximately 1.36 million shares or 9% of outstanding shares at a cost of approximately $82.8 million and at an average price of $60.88 per share, which effectively used up our September 2019 $100 million share repurchase authorization.
As a reminder, to continue to support our capital allocation strategy, we recently announced the approval of an additional $100 million repurchase authorization in February of this year, which represents our current availability.
Regarding capital allocation strategy, our immediate priority is to accomplish the substantial task of reinventorying, then invest in the business and continue to return cash to our shareholders through opportunistic share repurchases.
Capital expenditures were $19 million, including our new headquarters, and depreciation and amortization was $11 million.
We opened two stores and closed 11 during the fourth quarter to end the quarter with 1,425 total stores.
As we look toward fiscal year '23 guidance, we are excited about the year ahead and the continued momentum of our business.
But we recognize that we are faced with supply chain delivery delays, increased product, and logistics costs and the lapping of significant stimulus last year in the first half.
Regarding supply chain delays, we expect inventories to normalize late Q2 to early Q3.
In addition, we expect to experience wage pressures throughout the year.
After considering these factors, we expect fiscal year '23 sales to grow 2% to 4%.
For adjusted earnings per share, we expect a range of $7 to $7.75 per share with our best current expectation that earnings per share will be near the midpoint of the range.
Note that our full year guidance does not anticipate further significant supply chain disruptions or a more rapid escalation of inflation or geopolitical conflicts.
Regarding our individual businesses, for Journeys, we expect first-half sales to be below comparable fiscal year '22 levels since Journeys benefited considerably from stimulus last year.
We then expect growth in the back half as we assume inventories will normalize to pre-pandemic levels and would benefit from further price increases.
For Schuh, we expect growth for the year driven by more normalized store openings.
For J&M, we expect to return to pre-pandemic sales levels, and we expect growth for licensed brands as well.
Regarding gross margins, we expect gross margin rates to come down versus last year by roughly 40 to 50 basis points due mainly to increased markdown activity in the quarters in which markdowns normally occur as compared to essentially no promotional activity last year.
We expect adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales to deleverage in the range of 10 to 40 basis points.
This is driven by leverage from reduced performance-based compensation being offset by anniversarying significant onetime rent abatements, primarily at Schuh, and selling salary wage pressure.
In addition, we will have increased marketing investments to drive our business forward.
Our guidance assumes no additional share repurchases for the fiscal year, which results in fiscal '23 average shares outstanding of approximately 13.4 million, but we can repurchase opportunistically with availability under our most recent authorization.
Furthermore, we expect the tax rate to be approximately 28%.
In summary, this all results in expected operating margin below fiscal year '22, which beyond cost pressures, in large part, is due to a difficult first quarter and our belief that factors that led to such a strong full-price selling environment will not be sustained.
While we typically don't provide quarterly guidance, I want to provide some perspective on Q1.
As I said, we are lapping the benefits of fiscal year '22 stimulus, while at the same time experiencing delivery delays.
As a result, we expect Q1 sales to be below last year, which is the main driver of a good amount of SG&A deleverage in the quarter.
We are also anniversarying some onetime pickups like rent abatements in Q1 last year.
Regarding gross margin, increased air freight logistics costs are driving pressure, particularly at J&M.
The good news is we expect overall gross margin to be just under last year's levels.
With all of this, we expect a small loss in the quarter even as first-half earnings return more to a pre-pandemic cadence.
Also, it is worth noting for Q1, we expect to incur a small amount of tax expense due to our inability to recognize tax credits for our international operations.
The results Tom detailed clearly demonstrate that our footwear-focused strategy is advancing our business in this ever-changing environment.
This strategy, implemented before the pandemic, leverages our team's significant direct-to-consumer expertise across footwear, retail, and brands and the synergies between platforms.
Driving this strategy are six strategic pillars that emphasize continued investment in digital and omnichannel, deepening our consumer insights, driving product innovation, reshaping our cost base, and pursuing synergistic acquisitions, all to transform our business and exceed the expectations of today's consumer whose needs have rapidly advanced.
We continually refine our focus within the six pillars to take further advantage of the major changes underway in our industry.
Before we get to Q&A, let me walk you through the pillars and briefly highlight select initiatives for fiscal '23.
The first pillar is accelerate digital to grow the direct-to-consumer channel.
The investments we have made paid huge dividends and contributed meaningfully to our results these past two years as we achieved e-commerce sales growth of almost 80% over this time.
Importantly, our online business generates operating margins well into the double-digits due to our focus on full-price selling, disciplined marketing spend, and shipping and return policies to reinforce profitability.
This year, we are increasing our IT investments and resources to support digital.
We also believe continued enrichment of the digital shopping experience through fit refinement, try-on augmented reality and shop-the-look features will further add to digital growth in fiscal '23.
After a successful virtual try-on pilot program with Journeys this past year, we plan to roll out that program across all brands in the upcoming year.
Additionally, we accelerated automation to support omnichannel growth and we'll benefit from last year's go-live of our new carton-on-demand system and bespoke e-commerce packing module.
Lastly, we will add to our investment in digital marketing to drive traffic and attract new customers.
We expect marketing to be up more than 60% versus pre-pandemic spending, in large part, driven by these digital marketing increases.
Our second pillar is maximize the relationship between physical and digital channels.
During the pandemic, we increasingly saw the importance of these two channels working seamlessly together to provide consumers with their preferred shopping experiences, and we're building on and refining this relationship.
Our research has told us that over 30% of Journeys' target consumers visit local non-mall shopping centers two to three times per month and enjoy the convenience of shopping closer to home, combined with enhanced omnichannel services like easier curbside pickup.
We piloted a number of these off-mall locations, and we're very pleased with the early sales and four-wall results.
As such, we are expanding our portfolio of Journeys' non-mall locations and opening up to 30 new locations this year.
Tools like our new real estate analytics platform will allow us to optimize our site selection as we build out this footprint.
At Schuh, we are opening a new distribution center in Ireland to better support omnichannel sales there.
With this new center, we will also increase the efficiency of our Irish operations, while reducing costs resulting from new duties imposed post-Brexit.
Moving to our third pillar, building deeper consumer insights to strengthen consumer relationships and brand equity.
Data-driven consumer insights and more robust CRM capabilities are key to driving our next big wave of growth.
Because of the trusted relationship we have with our customers and their parents and the efforts to capture first-party data in our stores, we are currently able to identify 80%-plus of our Journeys and J&M customers.
This year, we will continue our investments in CRM and data analytics, particularly through database growth and loyalty program advancement.
We expect to fully launch our new Schuh loyalty program following a successful test in fiscal '22, grow our Johnston & Murphy program, which launched last year, and advance the work on a loyalty program for Journeys.
We will also invest to elevate the Journeys and Johnston & Murphy brands through increased marketing campaigns and spend to support this initiative.
Our fourth pillar, intensifying product innovation, and trend insight efforts, we will be utilizing new consumer insights to further innovate Johnston & Murphy's product offering and its accelerated shift to casual.
We have made tremendous progress reimagining the brand, highlighting proprietary innovation involving performance, advanced cushioning, and breathability technologies in both footwear and apparel, and growing Johnston & Murphy into its position as the No.
7 casual brand in the premium channel.
In addition, we will leverage our Togast capabilities and talent in connection with our new starter and Etonic licenses, which have shown strong presale demand and also build on the impressive growth achieved with the Levi's U.S. men's, women's, and kids' footwear license and category opportunities in areas like slippers, flip flops, and slides.
Finally, we are investing in a new scalable wholesale enterprise resource planning system to support the growth of our branded platform.
Pillar five, reshaping the cost base to reinvest for future growth has been a continuous effort, and especially at the store channel in working with our landlord partners to find a solution to rightsize rents to match traffic levels.
In addition to the approach Tom outlined for rent reduction, we are improving efficiency wherever we have people-intensive activities.
For example, this year, we're investing in new receiving automation in our Journeys distribution center, which should lower labor costs and increase productivity, especially during peak receiving periods.
And finally, pillar six, pursue synergistic acquisitions to enhance growth.
As we navigated an unprecedented environment over the last two years, acquisitions were not at the forefront of our strategy in spite of the success we're having with the Togast acquisition.
Now that many of the challenges of the pandemic are behind us, we will concentrate our efforts on opportunities to leverage our powerful direct-to-consumer capabilities to grow our branded platform and leverage its synergies.
So now to close, while we are so pleased with the year we just finished, we are even more excited about driving our footwear-focused strategy to deliver additional growth and shareholder value.
Operator, we're now ready to open the call to questions.

A very strong holiday season concluded an outstanding year.
Throughout fiscal '22, we accelerated our recovery from the pandemic and delivered record results for our footwear companies even as we navigated a number of acute challenges.
Despite multiple COVID variants, bottlenecks across the supply chain, labor shortages, and higher costs, we capitalized on the opportunity of a strong consumer spending environment to drive our business forward.
Our exceptional results underscore the earnings power of our business model, the solid foundation for growth we built through the strong competitive positions of our retail and branded concepts, and the successful execution of our footwear-focused strategy.
There are several key achievements that defined the year.
We grew revenue more than 35% over last year and 10% over fiscal '20.
Gross margin expansion and meaningful expense leverage drove record operating income for our footwear businesses as we achieved an operating margin above 6%.
We generated $240 million of operating cash flow, putting us in a great position to further invest in our business and return over $80 million to shareholders through share repurchases equal to 9% of outstanding shares, and we delivered record adjusted earnings per share of $7.62, an increase of more than 65% over fiscal '20.
Additional highlights include capitalizing on the accelerated shift to online spending and holding on to last year's almost 75% gain to reach almost $0.5 billion of digital sales, growing our branded wholesale business by almost $90 million versus two years ago, while improving profitability, adding new licenses and strengthening retail partnerships, and increasing store revenues over 40% from last year and nearly achieving fiscal '20 levels despite having 55 fewer stores.
Overall, our results highlight the work we've done to create and curate leading footwear brands and importantly, to strengthen our position as the leading destination for teen and youth-branded fashion footwear.
In today's channel-less world, where the consumer can truly shop anywhere, Journeys' and Schuh's growth underscores the tremendous loyalty developed with existing customers and compelling proposition offered to new customers.
Teens view us as the unparalleled fashion authority, choosing fashion-right brands and styles, validating whatever brands we're currently selling, and they are increasingly turning to our concept for their branded footwear needs.
We are not dependent on anyone brand for the majority of our revenue, but rather 10 or more brands typically constitute 80% of what we sell.
Trend-driven teens who are looking for the most current assortment of fashion footwear that is always evolving, whether they want to make a statement to stand out or want to fit in and be just like their friends, come to Journeys and Schuh to buy multiple brands and seek advice from our knowledgeable fashion advisor salespeople in our youth-focused full-service environment.
The effects from the pandemic on how consumers shop rather than harming our business was instead the catalyst to reach new heights.
Shifting now to the fourth quarter.
The work we did to have the right assortment and the right holiday marketing campaigns helped deliver Q4 results well ahead of expectations.
Consumer demand was robust, and we nonetheless believe our results would have been even stronger had we been able to maintain historic levels of inventory.
Our performance over last year's Q4 was driven by store sales and, versus two years ago, by digital and branded wholesale sales.
Q4 highlights include revenue up 14% over last year and 7% over two years ago.
Remarkably, we achieved this despite overall inventory being down almost 20% versus last year and down by one-third compared with the fourth quarter two years ago during the key holiday period.
With much more limited promotional activity, coupled with price increases, full-price selling was very strong, fueling a 300-plus basis point increase in gross margin versus last year, and a 200 basis point increase compared to two years ago, much stronger than expected.
Higher sales and this better-than-expected gross margin resulted in double-digit operating income expansion over pre-pandemic levels and record adjusted earnings per share of $3.48, an increase of more than 25% compared to last year's holiday season and 13% compared to two years ago.
From a channel perspective, the power of our omnichannel strategy was on full display in the fourth quarter as consumer appetite to shop in person, especially in the days leading up to Christmas, drove an almost 20% increase in-store sales over the year-ago period.
Strong demand in stores with many items selling as soon as they hit the store floor meant less store inventory than usual was available to service online demand.
We saw the biggest shift to in-store shopping in the U.K. as Schuh stores were open 100% of the quarter compared to roughly only a third of the days last year.
Despite the strong in-store sales in both Journeys and Schuh, we held on to almost 90% of last year's digital sales in total.
So turning now to discuss each business.
I'll start with Journeys and begin with a huge congratulations to the team on setting all-time records of sales and operating profit for the year.
Journeys' performance underscores the competitive advantages the business has built and how it has leveraged those advantages to further separate itself as the destination for branded fashion footwear for teens.
All of Journeys' Top 10 brands experienced year-over-year growth in fiscal '22 with most notching significant gains.
The current fashion cycle, which I've been describing, is shifting more into casual away from fashion athletic, plays into Journeys' strength, positioning Journeys well among its competition to deliver this assortment.
In anticipation of continued supply chain pressure, we encouraged customers to shop early and they did and the holiday season got off to a very strong start.
At this peak volume time, as the season unfolded, while traffic remained solid, conversion, which had been robust, dropped off as Journeys was not able to quickly replenish in-demand products to match outsized holiday demand.
While Journeys' talented store teams drove sales above last year's level, selling whatever was available, we believe Journeys' sales would have been meaningfully higher had we been able to get the inventory receipts we had ordered.
As a positive, tight inventory led to unprecedented levels of full-price selling with customers also willing to absorb price increases to secure desired product, driving further margin acceleration.
Finally, the Journeys team continues to live its core values of being a family with an attitude that cares, partnering during the holidays with nonprofit candidates and customers at the register for its largest national community activation, and donating $600,000 for bikes for underserved youth across the United States.
As part of this initiative, Journeys' headquarters employees built and donated 300 bikes and helmets to two Nashville elementary schools just in time for the holidays.
We were incredibly pleased with holiday results as Schuh capitalized on pent-up consumer demand and delivered Q4 constant currency revenue up more than 30% versus last year and 12% versus two years ago.
Like Journeys, Schuh's strength is its ability to deliver the fashion brands desired by its youth consumer and Schuh drove a nice growth across its diversified mix of both casual and fashion athletic footwear.
As a result of its stellar execution throughout the pandemic, navigating multiple store openings and closings, and making the most of its advanced digital capabilities, Schuh garnered improved product access being moved up a tier by a number of its high-profile brands.
This step forward in access, coupled with less severe supply chain disruptions and strong inventory management allowed Schuh to be in a better inventory position over the holidays.
U.K. customers were more comfortable shopping in person, leading to better in-store traffic, Schuh retained much of its digital gains from when stores were closed last year, resulting in a Q4 46% digital penetration.
Lastly, less promotional activity and product mix also drove strong margin gains.
Turning now to our branded side.
Our plan to reimagine Johnston & Murphy for a more casual, more comfortable, post-pandemic environment continues to prove out in the marketplace with the biggest Q4 bottom-line gain over last year of all of our businesses.
J&M continues to expand its focus from not just the products consumers need for work, but the products people desire for everyday life.
Q4's strong sell-through in boots, casual and casual athletic footwear, and equally strong performance in apparel and outerwear demonstrates just how far we've come, making J&M an attractive multi-category lifestyle brand.
This pivot has included new strategies for how and where we reach our customers.
New product story marketing campaigns have been very effective, and we've seen the most growth in our digital channel, up 14% compared to Q4 last year, and growth in our under-35 customer base, up 30% in Q4.
Much stronger demand and supply constraints pushed inventory more than 50% below pre-pandemic levels, hampering our ability to capture all of the demand during the holidays and return J&M to pre-pandemic sales.
Nevertheless, we're excited about J&M's trajectory and expect upside in the year to come.
Rounding out the discussion, momentum for Licensed Brands accelerated as the year progressed, notching impressive sales growth of 70% over last year as we successfully turned around the business and capitalized on the new capabilities we obtained with the Togast acquisition.
While supply chain disruption and excess freight costs weighed on the P&L throughout the year, we saw growing demand for both Levi's and Dockers footwear in value and full-price channels, positioning the business for improved profitability as these challenges subside, and we continue to take advantage of the white space in the marketplace.
In conclusion, our footwear-focused strategy is delivering results.
COVID provided the real opportunity to transform our business at a more rapid rate.
We are a healthier company today and delivered growth and improved earnings as a result of higher digital sales and profits, a more profitable store channel, and growing branded wholesale sales.
Our future is bright as we build upon the progress we have made.
Turning now to the current year.
Fiscal '22 had headwinds I have discussed and also some unique tailwinds, namely: healthy consumer spending in the first half due to significant government stimulus; an unusually good environment for full price selling as a result of high demand and scarcity of supply; and we benefited from some onetime gains related to rent and government relief, mostly in the U.K. With respect to fiscal '23, sales have gotten off to a much stronger start versus last year, but a slower start versus pre-pandemic, driven largely by the lower inventory level and lagging tax refunds.
We are expecting year-over-year trends to moderate as we anniversary stimulus and the lack of inventory further pressures growth early in the new year, especially in the first quarter.
Looking further into fiscal '23, we're working hard to overcome the cost pressures that are prevalent today, and we don't anticipate the factors that led to such a strong full-price selling environment to be sustained.
Tom will provide the financial details of our outlook momentarily, but we feel confident about delivering topline growth on top of a very strong fiscal '22.
Consistent with what I have outlined, we are planning the back half to be much stronger than the first half as inventory levels improve, logistics cost pressure starts to ease, and continued price actions help offset higher costs.
Fiscal '23 will also be an investment year for J&M as we advance the work on the brand's repositioning.
We expect adjusted earnings per share for fiscal '23 to be between $7 and $7.75 and believe somewhere close to the middle of the range is where the year will land.
While there are a number of variables at play, our results over what has been a very volatile past 24 months gives me great confidence in our team's ability to execute.
Finally, our ESG program will achieve an important milestone early in the year with the completion of our inaugural enterprisewide carbon footprint assessment.
Our work continues to progress with more to come when we publish a comprehensive ESG report later this spring.
Throughout fiscal '22, our employees stepped up wherever needed, and I can't overstate how critical this work was to our success.
Companies succeed like we have because of strong teams and dedicated people who help them achieve new heights.
I'm incredibly proud of what we accomplished together.
I would like to echo Mimi's remarks regarding the continued success of our key strategies and our amazing people.
With the year now behind us, we feel even more confident in our portfolio and the ability of our footwear-focused strategy to drive strong results.
Throughout the year, we saw continued strength in all our businesses, culminating in a strong Q4, which was driven by our team's ability to execute the strategies put in place.
Before I get into the details of the quarter, I want to again remind you as we have done throughout the year that we believe comparing to our pre-pandemic fiscal year '20, two years ago, typically provides the more difficult and often most meaningful assessment of our business.
However, when comparing to fiscal year '20, keep in mind how our strategy has changed our business.
E-commerce has become a larger percentage of sales along with wholesale sales for licensed brands.
These changes come with an overall lower gross margin rate due to the impact of direct shipping expenses and the expansion of our wholesale volume.
However, this should be more than offset with lower SG&A from these businesses.
While these changes are reshaping the P&L, they have a net positive impact on operating margins and an added benefit of a less capital-intensive business model.
Turning now to the specifics for the quarter.
Consolidated revenue was $728 million, up 7% compared to fiscal '20.
Journeys grew 2%, while Schuh grew 12% on a constant currency basis, and we more than tripled our licensed brands business.
As for J&M, the quarter started off strong in November, but supply chain challenges led to a significant lack of inventory, which led to J&M sales being down 12% for the quarter.
From a channel perspective, we experienced increases in both the e-com and wholesale channels.
And while we drove robust growth in the store channel, sales remained 4% below fiscal year '20, as scarcity of inventory impeded sales.
Worth noting as well is that we ended the quarter with 55 fewer stores than we had in fiscal year '20 as we optimized our store footprint.
On a year-over-year comp basis, however, total company comp-store sales were up 10% and were driven by comp sales of 6% at Journeys, 22% at Schuh, and 55% at J&M.
Finally, e-commerce sales were up 36% to fiscal '20 and accounted for 22% of total retail sales, up from 17% in fiscal year '20, while we also held on to 88% of last year's gains even while having the majority of our stores open during the quarter.
We were again very pleased with gross margins, which were up 310 basis points to last year and 200 basis points versus two years ago.
Strong full-price selling and price increases offset the channel mix impact of increased e-commerce and wholesale and increased logistics costs.
Increased logistics costs put approximately 120 basis points or $9 million of pressure on Q4 gross margin, and were the greatest drag in our branded businesses.
Journeys' and Schuh's gross margins were up 330 and 250 basis points, respectively, to fiscal year '20, driven by more full-price selling and higher footwear ASPs.
J&M's gross margin was up 420 basis points to fiscal '20, also benefiting from strong full-price selling and price increases, which also drove the release of slow-moving inventory reserves.
Finally, licensed brands' gross margin was down 190 basis points to fiscal year '20, as we experienced almost 1,000 basis points or almost $5 million of pressure from additional logistics costs, which more than offset margin improvements in the business.
Adjusted SG&A expense was 39.8%, which was 170 basis points more than fiscal '20 as deleverage from investments in marketing and higher incentive compensation more than offset leverage in occupancy and selling salaries.
As a reminder, our incentive compensation plan is based on year-over-year performance.
And comparatively speaking, we had a much lower bonus expense in fiscal year '20 Q4 than we did this year.
The other major driver of the deleverage was in marketing expense, which is due to our efforts to drive our digital footprint as well as brand awareness.
This coincided with price increases and digital marketing costs, including increased cost per click.
It's worth mentioning, last year's SG&A levels were unusually low, benefiting from 10s of millions of dollars of one-time COVID rent relief.
Regarding our rent reduction efforts for fiscal '22, we negotiated permanent reductions through 181 renewals, which achieved a 16% reduction in rent expense in North America on a straight-line basis.
This was on top of a 22% reduction for 123 renewals last year.
These renewals are for an even shorter term averaging approximately two years, compared to the three-year average we have seen in recent years.
With 45% of our fleet coming up for renewal in the next couple of years, this continues to remain a key priority.
Finally, we are pleased with our ability to leverage selling salaries, particularly in this higher cost and more difficult labor environment as we effectively utilized our workforce management tools.
Last quarter, we reported that we had identified the full amount of our $25 million to $30 million cost savings target.
A large part of these savings are from current and future reductions in store occupancy.
We will continue to focus our multiyear cost savings efforts on store channel profitability, including further efforts on reducing occupancy costs, gaining more efficiencies with selling salaries to mitigate the effects of wage pressures, and continually look for ways to further drive efficiencies, given the changing cost structure of the business.
In summary, fourth quarter adjusted operating income was $66 million, a 9.1% operating margin, compared to $59 million or 8.8% for fiscal year '20.
Versus last year, operating income improved by $2 million or 2.6%.
Again, last year's SG&A levels were unusually low, benefiting from significant COVID rent relief.
The impact of this was greatest at Journeys and in large part led to lower operating income this year despite higher sales and gross margins as Journeys anniversaried these onetime gains.
The profitability achieved during the quarter provides strong evidence of the operating margin expansion that we are continuing to see with our footwear-focused strategy as well as our ability to execute our growth algorithm.
As Mimi mentioned, for the fiscal year, we achieved north of a 6% operating margin, which was an important milestone in our long-range plan.
For the quarter, our adjusted non-GAAP tax rate was 25%, which compares favorably to the 37% last year due to the impact of the Cares Act tax provisions in the fourth quarter of fiscal year '21.
This resulted in adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.48 for the quarter, which compares to $2.76 last year and $3.09 in fiscal '20.
Turning now to the balance sheet.
Q4 total ending inventory was down 24%, compared to fiscal '20 on sales that were up 7%.
At the end of the quarter, all our business experienced inventory shortfalls versus fiscal '20 with the most impacted in Journeys and J&M, which were down 20% and 39%, respectively.
Our strong net cash position of $305 million, an increase of over $120 million versus last year, was driven by our strong operating performance.
Additionally, we consolidated operations and sold a warehouse, realizing a sizable gain on the transaction.
This strong performance and our confidence in the business enabled us to continue to return cash to our shareholders through the repurchase of 840,000 shares of stock for $52 million at an average price of $62.22 per share during the quarter.
Total fiscal '22 share repurchases were approximately 1.36 million shares or 9% of outstanding shares at a cost of approximately $82.8 million and at an average price of $60.88 per share, which effectively used up our September 2019 $100 million share repurchase authorization.
As a reminder, to continue to support our capital allocation strategy, we recently announced the approval of an additional $100 million repurchase authorization in February of this year, which represents our current availability.
Regarding capital allocation strategy, our immediate priority is to accomplish the substantial task of reinventorying, then invest in the business and continue to return cash to our shareholders through opportunistic share repurchases.
Capital expenditures were $19 million, including our new headquarters, and depreciation and amortization was $11 million.
We opened two stores and closed 11 during the fourth quarter to end the quarter with 1,425 total stores.
As we look toward fiscal year '23 guidance, we are excited about the year ahead and the continued momentum of our business.
But we recognize that we are faced with supply chain delivery delays, increased product, and logistics costs and the lapping of significant stimulus last year in the first half.
Regarding supply chain delays, we expect inventories to normalize late Q2 to early Q3.
In addition, we expect to experience wage pressures throughout the year.
After considering these factors, we expect fiscal year '23 sales to grow 2% to 4%.
For adjusted earnings per share, we expect a range of $7 to $7.75 per share with our best current expectation that earnings per share will be near the midpoint of the range.
Note that our full year guidance does not anticipate further significant supply chain disruptions or a more rapid escalation of inflation or geopolitical conflicts.
Regarding our individual businesses, for Journeys, we expect first-half sales to be below comparable fiscal year '22 levels since Journeys benefited considerably from stimulus last year.
We then expect growth in the back half as we assume inventories will normalize to pre-pandemic levels and would benefit from further price increases.
For Schuh, we expect growth for the year driven by more normalized store openings.
For J&M, we expect to return to pre-pandemic sales levels, and we expect growth for licensed brands as well.
Regarding gross margins, we expect gross margin rates to come down versus last year by roughly 40 to 50 basis points due mainly to increased markdown activity in the quarters in which markdowns normally occur as compared to essentially no promotional activity last year.
We expect adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales to deleverage in the range of 10 to 40 basis points.
This is driven by leverage from reduced performance-based compensation being offset by anniversarying significant onetime rent abatements, primarily at Schuh, and selling salary wage pressure.
In addition, we will have increased marketing investments to drive our business forward.
Our guidance assumes no additional share repurchases for the fiscal year, which results in fiscal '23 average shares outstanding of approximately 13.4 million, but we can repurchase opportunistically with availability under our most recent authorization.
Furthermore, we expect the tax rate to be approximately 28%.
In summary, this all results in expected operating margin below fiscal year '22, which beyond cost pressures, in large part, is due to a difficult first quarter and our belief that factors that led to such a strong full-price selling environment will not be sustained.
While we typically don't provide quarterly guidance, I want to provide some perspective on Q1.
As I said, we are lapping the benefits of fiscal year '22 stimulus, while at the same time experiencing delivery delays.
As a result, we expect Q1 sales to be below last year, which is the main driver of a good amount of SG&A deleverage in the quarter.
We are also anniversarying some onetime pickups like rent abatements in Q1 last year.
Regarding gross margin, increased air freight logistics costs are driving pressure, particularly at J&M.
The good news is we expect overall gross margin to be just under last year's levels.
With all of this, we expect a small loss in the quarter even as first-half earnings return more to a pre-pandemic cadence.
Also, it is worth noting for Q1, we expect to incur a small amount of tax expense due to our inability to recognize tax credits for our international operations.
The results Tom detailed clearly demonstrate that our footwear-focused strategy is advancing our business in this ever-changing environment.
This strategy, implemented before the pandemic, leverages our team's significant direct-to-consumer expertise across footwear, retail, and brands and the synergies between platforms.
Driving this strategy are six strategic pillars that emphasize continued investment in digital and omnichannel, deepening our consumer insights, driving product innovation, reshaping our cost base, and pursuing synergistic acquisitions, all to transform our business and exceed the expectations of today's consumer whose needs have rapidly advanced.
We continually refine our focus within the six pillars to take further advantage of the major changes underway in our industry.
Before we get to Q&A, let me walk you through the pillars and briefly highlight select initiatives for fiscal '23.
The first pillar is accelerate digital to grow the direct-to-consumer channel.
The investments we have made paid huge dividends and contributed meaningfully to our results these past two years as we achieved e-commerce sales growth of almost 80% over this time.
Importantly, our online business generates operating margins well into the double-digits due to our focus on full-price selling, disciplined marketing spend, and shipping and return policies to reinforce profitability.
This year, we are increasing our IT investments and resources to support digital.
We also believe continued enrichment of the digital shopping experience through fit refinement, try-on augmented reality and shop-the-look features will further add to digital growth in fiscal '23.
After a successful virtual try-on pilot program with Journeys this past year, we plan to roll out that program across all brands in the upcoming year.
Additionally, we accelerated automation to support omnichannel growth and we'll benefit from last year's go-live of our new carton-on-demand system and bespoke e-commerce packing module.
Lastly, we will add to our investment in digital marketing to drive traffic and attract new customers.
We expect marketing to be up more than 60% versus pre-pandemic spending, in large part, driven by these digital marketing increases.
Our second pillar is maximize the relationship between physical and digital channels.
During the pandemic, we increasingly saw the importance of these two channels working seamlessly together to provide consumers with their preferred shopping experiences, and we're building on and refining this relationship.
Our research has told us that over 30% of Journeys' target consumers visit local non-mall shopping centers two to three times per month and enjoy the convenience of shopping closer to home, combined with enhanced omnichannel services like easier curbside pickup.
We piloted a number of these off-mall locations, and we're very pleased with the early sales and four-wall results.
As such, we are expanding our portfolio of Journeys' non-mall locations and opening up to 30 new locations this year.
Tools like our new real estate analytics platform will allow us to optimize our site selection as we build out this footprint.
At Schuh, we are opening a new distribution center in Ireland to better support omnichannel sales there.
With this new center, we will also increase the efficiency of our Irish operations, while reducing costs resulting from new duties imposed post-Brexit.
Moving to our third pillar, building deeper consumer insights to strengthen consumer relationships and brand equity.
Data-driven consumer insights and more robust CRM capabilities are key to driving our next big wave of growth.
Because of the trusted relationship we have with our customers and their parents and the efforts to capture first-party data in our stores, we are currently able to identify 80%-plus of our Journeys and J&M customers.
This year, we will continue our investments in CRM and data analytics, particularly through database growth and loyalty program advancement.
We expect to fully launch our new Schuh loyalty program following a successful test in fiscal '22, grow our Johnston & Murphy program, which launched last year, and advance the work on a loyalty program for Journeys.
We will also invest to elevate the Journeys and Johnston & Murphy brands through increased marketing campaigns and spend to support this initiative.
Our fourth pillar, intensifying product innovation, and trend insight efforts, we will be utilizing new consumer insights to further innovate Johnston & Murphy's product offering and its accelerated shift to casual.
We have made tremendous progress reimagining the brand, highlighting proprietary innovation involving performance, advanced cushioning, and breathability technologies in both footwear and apparel, and growing Johnston & Murphy into its position as the No.
7 casual brand in the premium channel.
In addition, we will leverage our Togast capabilities and talent in connection with our new starter and Etonic licenses, which have shown strong presale demand and also build on the impressive growth achieved with the Levi's U.S. men's, women's, and kids' footwear license and category opportunities in areas like slippers, flip flops, and slides.
Finally, we are investing in a new scalable wholesale enterprise resource planning system to support the growth of our branded platform.
Pillar five, reshaping the cost base to reinvest for future growth has been a continuous effort, and especially at the store channel in working with our landlord partners to find a solution to rightsize rents to match traffic levels.
In addition to the approach Tom outlined for rent reduction, we are improving efficiency wherever we have people-intensive activities.
For example, this year, we're investing in new receiving automation in our Journeys distribution center, which should lower labor costs and increase productivity, especially during peak receiving periods.
And finally, pillar six, pursue synergistic acquisitions to enhance growth.
As we navigated an unprecedented environment over the last two years, acquisitions were not at the forefront of our strategy in spite of the success we're having with the Togast acquisition.
Now that many of the challenges of the pandemic are behind us, we will concentrate our efforts on opportunities to leverage our powerful direct-to-consumer capabilities to grow our branded platform and leverage its synergies.
So now to close, while we are so pleased with the year we just finished, we are even more excited about driving our footwear-focused strategy to deliver additional growth and shareholder value.

### Input:
These statements reflect the participants' expectations as of today, but actual results could be different.
Participants also expect to refer to certain adjusted financial measures during the call.
A very strong holiday season concluded an outstanding year.
Throughout fiscal '22, we accelerated our recovery from the pandemic and delivered record results for our footwear companies even as we navigated a number of acute challenges.
Despite multiple COVID variants, bottlenecks across the supply chain, labor shortages, and higher costs, we capitalized on the opportunity of a strong consumer spending environment to drive our business forward.
Our exceptional results underscore the earnings power of our business model, the solid foundation for growth we built through the strong competitive positions of our retail and branded concepts, and the successful execution of our footwear-focused strategy.
There are several key achievements that defined the year.
We grew revenue more than 35% over last year and 10% over fiscal '20.
Gross margin expansion and meaningful expense leverage drove record operating income for our footwear businesses as we achieved an operating margin above 6%.
We generated $240 million of operating cash flow, putting us in a great position to further invest in our business and return over $80 million to shareholders through share repurchases equal to 9% of outstanding shares, and we delivered record adjusted earnings per share of $7.62, an increase of more than 65% over fiscal '20.
Additional highlights include capitalizing on the accelerated shift to online spending and holding on to last year's almost 75% gain to reach almost $0.5 billion of digital sales, growing our branded wholesale business by almost $90 million versus two years ago, while improving profitability, adding new licenses and strengthening retail partnerships, and increasing store revenues over 40% from last year and nearly achieving fiscal '20 levels despite having 55 fewer stores.
Overall, our results highlight the work we've done to create and curate leading footwear brands and importantly, to strengthen our position as the leading destination for teen and youth-branded fashion footwear.
In today's channel-less world, where the consumer can truly shop anywhere, Journeys' and Schuh's growth underscores the tremendous loyalty developed with existing customers and compelling proposition offered to new customers.
Teens view us as the unparalleled fashion authority, choosing fashion-right brands and styles, validating whatever brands we're currently selling, and they are increasingly turning to our concept for their branded footwear needs.
We are not dependent on anyone brand for the majority of our revenue, but rather 10 or more brands typically constitute 80% of what we sell.
Trend-driven teens who are looking for the most current assortment of fashion footwear that is always evolving, whether they want to make a statement to stand out or want to fit in and be just like their friends, come to Journeys and Schuh to buy multiple brands and seek advice from our knowledgeable fashion advisor salespeople in our youth-focused full-service environment.
The effects from the pandemic on how consumers shop rather than harming our business was instead the catalyst to reach new heights.
Shifting now to the fourth quarter.
The work we did to have the right assortment and the right holiday marketing campaigns helped deliver Q4 results well ahead of expectations.
Consumer demand was robust, and we nonetheless believe our results would have been even stronger had we been able to maintain historic levels of inventory.
Our performance over last year's Q4 was driven by store sales and, versus two years ago, by digital and branded wholesale sales.
Q4 highlights include revenue up 14% over last year and 7% over two years ago.
Remarkably, we achieved this despite overall inventory being down almost 20% versus last year and down by one-third compared with the fourth quarter two years ago during the key holiday period.
With much more limited promotional activity, coupled with price increases, full-price selling was very strong, fueling a 300-plus basis point increase in gross margin versus last year, and a 200 basis point increase compared to two years ago, much stronger than expected.
Higher sales and this better-than-expected gross margin resulted in double-digit operating income expansion over pre-pandemic levels and record adjusted earnings per share of $3.48, an increase of more than 25% compared to last year's holiday season and 13% compared to two years ago.
From a channel perspective, the power of our omnichannel strategy was on full display in the fourth quarter as consumer appetite to shop in person, especially in the days leading up to Christmas, drove an almost 20% increase in-store sales over the year-ago period.
Strong demand in stores with many items selling as soon as they hit the store floor meant less store inventory than usual was available to service online demand.
We saw the biggest shift to in-store shopping in the U.K. as Schuh stores were open 100%"
16,"I'm Aaron Hunt, Director of Investor Relations.
We are pleased to see signs of recovery in global air traffic.
The U.S. air travel recovery has been strong and has come back faster than some expected.
TSA traveler throughput has exceeded two million passengers on multiple days during the past two months and some days in July where passenger screenings exceeded the 2019 levels.
A recent International Air Transport Association report indicates domestic passenger market show improvement, but with demand still down 22% versus June 2019 levels.
The situation remains dynamic.
We are monitoring the most recent reports of a spike of COVID-19 cases and what impact this may have on air traffic recovery.
However, the upward momentum of domestic air traffic over the past few months is an encouraging trend for our industry.
We are pleased to see the rebound of demand for the MAX and the news of large orders from United, Southwest, Alaska Air and Ryanair.
Ryanair took delivery of its first 737 MAX 8200 and had positive feedback.
With 85% of Spirit's backlog associated with narrow-body aircraft, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from this domestic air traffic demand and narrow-body recovery.
In the first half of this year, we delivered 64 737 shipsets compared to 37 in the first half of last year, a 73% increase.
We are also on track to deliver about 160 shipsets this year, a 125% increase over the 71 we delivered in 2020.
As we have discussed before, we are trailing Boeing in terms of 737 production rate to burn off the inventory of storage shipsets in Wichita and Tulsa.
This quarter, for example, we delivered 35 units but shipped 42 to Boeing.
We currently have about 125 units in storage, all of which Boeing owns.
We expect store units will decrease to about 100 shipsets by the end of the year.
Our plan is that we will reach 20 stored units by the end of next year, which will remain as a permanent buffer to cushion the production system.
Turning to the 787 program.
As a result of our ongoing engagement with Boeing, we identified an additional fit and finish issue in the forward section of the fuselage.
This issue is related to a part that Spirit receives from one of our Tier two suppliers, and we are working with Boeing and the supplier on a resolution.
We continue to coordinate with Boeing to ensure that we are performing all necessary rework.
Primarily driven by this issue, we have recognized a $46 million forward loss on the 787 program.
Despite this forward loss, we are maintaining our free cash flow target of negative $200 million to $300 million, as indicated on our last earnings call.
This amount is net of the $300 million cash tax benefit, which we expect to receive in the second half of this year.
Next, I would like to highlight the fact that we published our first sustainability report in June, outlining Spirit's environmental, social and governance strategy.
The report also includes a few of our notable 2020 achievements.
For example, by the end of this year, we intend to be 100% wind powered at our Wichita facility.
Now our Chief Operating Officer, Sam Marnick, will take you through updates on our acquisition integrations.
The integration workstreams for our recent acquisitions are progressing well.
We recently acquired the assets of Applied Aerodynamics, and we've already completed approximately 60% of the 323 identified integration tasks.
The integration of our other acquisition from Bombardier is also going well.
We have completed about 90% of the tasks required to integrate the Belfast, Morocco and Dallas site.
The remaining tasks are largely associated with the information technology transition services agreement, and we expect to complete it before the end of the year.
The estimated synergies we're expecting from the deal are tracking to plan.
We have seen good progress on A220 wing costs, supply chain improvements and infrastructure optimization.
Airbus continues to have confidence in this aircraft, and we expect production rates to continue to improve over time.
Turning to the Belfast pension plan.
We have ended our formal consultation with employees and the unions.
Subject to the completion of the process, we will close the plan to future benefit accrual and provide a defined contribution benefit plan before the end of the year.
The Bombardier asset acquisition significantly increased our business jet work statement.
We also secured the award of the engine nacelle on the new Falcon 10 times.
This new growth has established Spirit as a leading business jet aerostructure supplier, a market segment that is recovering rapidly following the pandemic.
These business aircraft inventories are down around 40% year-over-year, highlighting a strong demand.
Additionally, U.S. business jet flight activity is about 6% higher than prepandemic levels, another good indicator of a rebound in this market segment.
We believe our capabilities and business ship programs position us well to generate $500 million of revenue at accretive margins by 2023.
Another market segment, we are watching closely is urban air mobility, also referred to as electric vertical and take off aircraft or eVTOL.
We believe our expertise in composite aerostructure design and manufacturing bring unique capabilities in this future mode of transport.
We've been exploring opportunities with a number of companies in this exciting new area and have signed agreements that are already generating revenue.
These two acquisitions have helped us grow our aftermarket and business jet businesses.
We are also accelerating our revenue diversification efforts in defense, which we expect will grow by roughly 20% in 2021.
I hope everybody is doing well.
We continue to see 2021 as a bridge year for our Spirit and the commercial aviation industry.
Domestic air travel in the United States as well as many other regions of the world are starting to recover, which is encouraging, especially for narrow-body aircraft production rates.
We are cautiously monitoring the COVID variant and its impact on this recovery, particularly with international travel.
We expect international air travel will continue to recover at a slower pace, and therefore, wide-body programs will remain a headwind for the next few years.
As we work through the second half of the year, we are starting to see the benefits of increasing narrow-body production rates.
Now let's move to our second quarter 2021 results.
Revenue for the quarter was $1 billion, up 55% from the same quarter of last year and approximately 11% above the first quarter of 2021.
The revenue increase was primarily due to production on the 737 and A320 programs as well as increased revenue from the recently acquired A220 wing and Bombardier business jet programs.
These increases were partially offset by the lower wide-body production rates resulting from the continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on international air traffic.
Overall deliveries increased to 243 shipsets compared to 159 shipsets in the same quarter of 2020.
The second quarter 737 deliveries have increased to 35 compared to 19 shipsets delivered in the second quarter of last year.
We still expect to deliver around 160 shipsets during the year.
Additionally, second quarter A320 deliveries increased to 96 compared to 69 shipsets delivered in the same period of last year.
Let's now turn to earnings per share on slide four.
We reported earnings per share of negative $1.30 compared to negative $2.46 per share in the same period of 2020.
Adjusted earnings per share was negative $0.31 compared to earnings per share of $2.28 in the second quarter of 2020.
Adjusted earnings per share excludes acquisition costs, restructuring costs, noncash voluntary retirement plan charges and deferred tax asset valuation allowance.
Looking at the operating margin, we saw improvement in the second quarter to negative 10% and compared to negative 57% in the second quarter of 2020.
The cost-reduction actions we have taken over the last year, along with increasing production rates, have contributed to the improved results with lower cost and expenses, including excess capacity, restructuring and abnormal COVID-19 costs.
We also recognized lower forward loss charges compared to the same period last year.
In the second quarter, we recognized forward loss charges of $52 million, primarily driven by engineering analysis and rework on the 787 program compared to forward loss charges of $194 million in the same period of 2020.
Additionally, the increase in other income is primarily related to Belfast pension plan and the absence of voluntary retirement expenses recognized in the second quarter of 2020.
I do want to mention that there was a revaluation of deferred tax assets during the second quarter of 2021 due to a future increase of the United Kingdom's corporate tax rate.
This resulted in an income tax benefit of approximately $55 million.
This benefit is included in both GAAP and adjusted EPS.
The revaluation of deferred tax assets, along with the adjustments related to tax law changes and other state tax impacts, resulted in incremental adjustments to the valuation allowance.

Earlier this week, Spirit received the latest 787 program demand from Boeing.
Based on our preliminary assessment, we expect to incur an incremental forward loss of approximately $40 million to $60 million in the third quarter of 2021 due to the impact of reduced production volumes and the corresponding amount of fixed overhead absorption applied to lower deliveries.
Due to the timing, this is considered a subsequent event and is not reflected in our second quarter financial statements.
Now turning to free cash flow on slide five.
Free cash flow for the quarter was negative $53 million compared to negative -- $249 million negative in the same period of 2020.
This year-over-year improvement is primarily due to cost-reduction actions, increased production volume and favorable working capital management.
The second quarter cash from operations also reflect an improvement of $142 million as compared to the first quarter of '21.
Excluding the cash interest payments of approximately $80 million made during the second quarter, cash from operations was positive $51 million.
We expect the second half of this year to improve as single-aisle production rates continue to increase.
Despite the additional challenge of the 787 program, we continue to expect free cash flow for the year to be between negative $200 million and $300 million.
Let's now turn to our cash and debt balances on slide six.
We ended the second quarter with $1.3 billion of cash and $3.6 billion of debt.
In February, we paid $300 million floating rate notes early, and we remain on track to repay $1 billion in debt during the next three years.
The timing will be in line with air traffic and narrow-body production rate recoveries.
The cadence of the global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic could result in fluctuations in our cash flows from period-to-period.
Now let's turn to our segment performance on slide seven.
In the second quarter, fuselage segment revenues were $492 million, up 51% compared to the same period of 2020, primarily due to higher production volumes on the 737 and Bombardier business jet program, partially offset by lower production volumes on the 787 program.
Operating margin for the quarter was negative 7% compared to negative 77% in the same period of the prior year, primarily due to increased 737 production volumes and the resulting decrease in excess capacity costs as well as less net forward losses in the absence of a loss on disposal charges.
The fuselage segment recorded $4 million of favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments and $36 million of net forward losses during the quarter, primarily due to the 787 program.
Propulsion revenue in the quarter improved to $242 million, up 43% compared to the same period of 2020, primarily due to higher revenue on the 737 program and aftermarket sales, partially offset by decreased volume on the 777 program.
Despite the challenging environment, operating margin for the quarter was positive 12%.
This is compared to negative 10% in the same quarter of 2020.
Increased 737 production and the resulting decrease in excess capacity costs as well as less forward loss charges were the main drivers to the improvement in the segment profitability.
The segment recorded $6 million of favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments and $9 million of forward losses.
High production volumes on the 737, A220 and A320 programs were the main contributors to the increase in wing revenue to $259 million.
Operating margin for the quarter was negative 6% compared to negative 35% in the second quarter of 2020.
The increases in segment profitability and operating margin were primarily a result of increased A320 production volume as well as less forward losses compared to the same period of 2020.
The segment recorded $8 million of net forward losses.

We are pleased to see signs of recovery in global air traffic.
The U.S. air travel recovery has been strong and has come back faster than some expected.
TSA traveler throughput has exceeded two million passengers on multiple days during the past two months and some days in July where passenger screenings exceeded the 2019 levels.
A recent International Air Transport Association report indicates domestic passenger market show improvement, but with demand still down 22% versus June 2019 levels.
The situation remains dynamic.
We are monitoring the most recent reports of a spike of COVID-19 cases and what impact this may have on air traffic recovery.
However, the upward momentum of domestic air traffic over the past few months is an encouraging trend for our industry.
We are pleased to see the rebound of demand for the MAX and the news of large orders from United, Southwest, Alaska Air and Ryanair.
Ryanair took delivery of its first 737 MAX 8200 and had positive feedback.
With 85% of Spirit's backlog associated with narrow-body aircraft, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from this domestic air traffic demand and narrow-body recovery.
In the first half of this year, we delivered 64 737 shipsets compared to 37 in the first half of last year, a 73% increase.
We are also on track to deliver about 160 shipsets this year, a 125% increase over the 71 we delivered in 2020.
As we have discussed before, we are trailing Boeing in terms of 737 production rate to burn off the inventory of storage shipsets in Wichita and Tulsa.
This quarter, for example, we delivered 35 units but shipped 42 to Boeing.
We currently have about 125 units in storage, all of which Boeing owns.
We expect store units will decrease to about 100 shipsets by the end of the year.
Our plan is that we will reach 20 stored units by the end of next year, which will remain as a permanent buffer to cushion the production system.
Turning to the 787 program.
As a result of our ongoing engagement with Boeing, we identified an additional fit and finish issue in the forward section of the fuselage.
This issue is related to a part that Spirit receives from one of our Tier two suppliers, and we are working with Boeing and the supplier on a resolution.
We continue to coordinate with Boeing to ensure that we are performing all necessary rework.
Primarily driven by this issue, we have recognized a $46 million forward loss on the 787 program.
Despite this forward loss, we are maintaining our free cash flow target of negative $200 million to $300 million, as indicated on our last earnings call.
This amount is net of the $300 million cash tax benefit, which we expect to receive in the second half of this year.
Next, I would like to highlight the fact that we published our first sustainability report in June, outlining Spirit's environmental, social and governance strategy.
The report also includes a few of our notable 2020 achievements.
For example, by the end of this year, we intend to be 100% wind powered at our Wichita facility.
Now our Chief Operating Officer, Sam Marnick, will take you through updates on our acquisition integrations.
The integration workstreams for our recent acquisitions are progressing well.
We recently acquired the assets of Applied Aerodynamics, and we've already completed approximately 60% of the 323 identified integration tasks.
The integration of our other acquisition from Bombardier is also going well.
We have completed about 90% of the tasks required to integrate the Belfast, Morocco and Dallas site.
The remaining tasks are largely associated with the information technology transition services agreement, and we expect to complete it before the end of the year.
The estimated synergies we're expecting from the deal are tracking to plan.
We have seen good progress on A220 wing costs, supply chain improvements and infrastructure optimization.
Airbus continues to have confidence in this aircraft, and we expect production rates to continue to improve over time.
Turning to the Belfast pension plan.
We have ended our formal consultation with employees and the unions.
Subject to the completion of the process, we will close the plan to future benefit accrual and provide a defined contribution benefit plan before the end of the year.
The Bombardier asset acquisition significantly increased our business jet work statement.
We also secured the award of the engine nacelle on the new Falcon 10 times.
This new growth has established Spirit as a leading business jet aerostructure supplier, a market segment that is recovering rapidly following the pandemic.
These business aircraft inventories are down around 40% year-over-year, highlighting a strong demand.
Additionally, U.S. business jet flight activity is about 6% higher than prepandemic levels, another good indicator of a rebound in this market segment.
We believe our capabilities and business ship programs position us well to generate $500 million of revenue at accretive margins by 2023.
Another market segment, we are watching closely is urban air mobility, also referred to as electric vertical and take off aircraft or eVTOL.
We believe our expertise in composite aerostructure design and manufacturing bring unique capabilities in this future mode of transport.
We've been exploring opportunities with a number of companies in this exciting new area and have signed agreements that are already generating revenue.
These two acquisitions have helped us grow our aftermarket and business jet businesses.
We are also accelerating our revenue diversification efforts in defense, which we expect will grow by roughly 20% in 2021.
I hope everybody is doing well.
We continue to see 2021 as a bridge year for our Spirit and the commercial aviation industry.
Domestic air travel in the United States as well as many other regions of the world are starting to recover, which is encouraging, especially for narrow-body aircraft production rates.
We are cautiously monitoring the COVID variant and its impact on this recovery, particularly with international travel.
We expect international air travel will continue to recover at a slower pace, and therefore, wide-body programs will remain a headwind for the next few years.
As we work through the second half of the year, we are starting to see the benefits of increasing narrow-body production rates.
Now let's move to our second quarter 2021 results.
Revenue for the quarter was $1 billion, up 55% from the same quarter of last year and approximately 11% above the first quarter of 2021.
The revenue increase was primarily due to production on the 737 and A320 programs as well as increased revenue from the recently acquired A220 wing and Bombardier business jet programs.
These increases were partially offset by the lower wide-body production rates resulting from the continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on international air traffic.
Overall deliveries increased to 243 shipsets compared to 159 shipsets in the same quarter of 2020.
The second quarter 737 deliveries have increased to 35 compared to 19 shipsets delivered in the second quarter of last year.
We still expect to deliver around 160 shipsets during the year.
Additionally, second quarter A320 deliveries increased to 96 compared to 69 shipsets delivered in the same period of last year.
Let's now turn to earnings per share on slide four.
We reported earnings per share of negative $1.30 compared to negative $2.46 per share in the same period of 2020.
Adjusted earnings per share was negative $0.31 compared to earnings per share of $2.28 in the second quarter of 2020.
Adjusted earnings per share excludes acquisition costs, restructuring costs, noncash voluntary retirement plan charges and deferred tax asset valuation allowance.
Looking at the operating margin, we saw improvement in the second quarter to negative 10% and compared to negative 57% in the second quarter of 2020.
The cost-reduction actions we have taken over the last year, along with increasing production rates, have contributed to the improved results with lower cost and expenses, including excess capacity, restructuring and abnormal COVID-19 costs.
We also recognized lower forward loss charges compared to the same period last year.
In the second quarter, we recognized forward loss charges of $52 million, primarily driven by engineering analysis and rework on the 787 program compared to forward loss charges of $194 million in the same period of 2020.
Additionally, the increase in other income is primarily related to Belfast pension plan and the absence of voluntary retirement expenses recognized in the second quarter of 2020.
I do want to mention that there was a revaluation of deferred tax assets during the second quarter of 2021 due to a future increase of the United Kingdom's corporate tax rate.
This resulted in an income tax benefit of approximately $55 million.
This benefit is included in both GAAP and adjusted EPS.
The revaluation of deferred tax assets, along with the adjustments related to tax law changes and other state tax impacts, resulted in incremental adjustments to the valuation allowance.
As a reminder, the valuation allowance is a noncash item.
Earlier this week, Spirit received the latest 787 program demand from Boeing.
Based on our preliminary assessment, we expect to incur an incremental forward loss of approximately $40 million to $60 million in the third quarter of 2021 due to the impact of reduced production volumes and the corresponding amount of fixed overhead absorption applied to lower deliveries.
Due to the timing, this is considered a subsequent event and is not reflected in our second quarter financial statements.
Now turning to free cash flow on slide five.
Free cash flow for the quarter was negative $53 million compared to negative -- $249 million negative in the same period of 2020.
This year-over-year improvement is primarily due to cost-reduction actions, increased production volume and favorable working capital management.
The second quarter cash from operations also reflect an improvement of $142 million as compared to the first quarter of '21.
Excluding the cash interest payments of approximately $80 million made during the second quarter, cash from operations was positive $51 million.
We expect the second half of this year to improve as single-aisle production rates continue to increase.
Despite the additional challenge of the 787 program, we continue to expect free cash flow for the year to be between negative $200 million and $300 million.
Let's now turn to our cash and debt balances on slide six.
We ended the second quarter with $1.3 billion of cash and $3.6 billion of debt.
In February, we paid $300 million floating rate notes early, and we remain on track to repay $1 billion in debt during the next three years.

17,"Mark will review our second quarter results, provide our outlook for the remainder of 2021 and discuss our diamides business.
Andrew will provide an overview of select financial items.
Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's understanding.
Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties.
Today's discussion and the supporting materials will include references to adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cash from operations, free cash flow and organic revenue growth, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures.
Please note that as used in today's discussion, earnings means adjusted earnings and EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA.
A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call are provided on our website.
Our second quarter results, revenue up 8%, EBITDA up 2% and earnings per share up 5% year-over-year were slightly ahead of our guidance.
These results were fundamentally driven by volume, reflecting robust demand for FMC products around the world.
Innovation continues to be a catalyst for growth.
New products introduced in the last 12 months contributed $30 million in sales growth in the quarter and our plant health products, including biologicals, posted Q2 sales growth in the high teens.
We continue to expect a very strong second half of 2021, driven by robust volume growth.
We have lowered our full year earnings guidance due to the continued acceleration of raw material, packaging and logistics costs.
We will go into this in more details later.
I'd like to take a moment to provide a COVID-19 update on our business.
All our manufacturing facilities and distribution warehouses remain operational and properly staffed.
Our research laboratories and greenhouses also have continued to operate throughout the pandemic.
We are resuming in-office operations work permitted by local authorities.
And in June, we introduced flexible work arrangements to facilitate the return of all our staff to our headquarters in Philadelphia as well as some other locations in adherence with local guidelines.
Turning to our Q2 results on slide three.
We reported $1.2 billion in second quarter revenue, which reflects an 8% increase on a reported basis and a 4% increase organically.
Asia and Latin America posted the largest growth of 20% and 15%, respectively.
Our fungicides grew over 50% in the quarter, driven by the Xyway launch in the U.S., and fungicides represented 8% of total sales in Q2 versus 5% of our sales in the prior year period.
Adjusted EBITDA was $347 million, an increase of 2% compared to the prior year period and $2 million above the midpoint of our guidance range.
EBITDA margins were 28%, a decrease of 150 basis points compared to the prior year, reflecting the impact of continued and accelerating cost headwinds.
Adjusted earnings were $1.81 per diluted share in the quarter, an increase of 5% versus Q2 2020 and also $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance range.
The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by the increases in EBITDA and lower interest expense.
Moving now to slide four.
Despite the unfavorable weather conditions in several regions, Q2 revenue increased by 8% versus the prior year, driven by a 4% volume increase and a 4% tailwind from foreign currencies.
Pricing was essentially flat year-over-year.
Sales in Asia increased 20% year-over-year and 13% organically, driven by double-digit growth in India, Australia, Indonesia and Pakistan.
Insecticides contributed the greatest growth, including Altacor for cotton, and herbicide sales were also very strong, driven by share gains in India for soybean and sugarcane applications as well as robust sales in Australia.
In Latin America, sales increased 15% year-over-year and 12% organically.
Mexico and Colombia each posted double-digit growth, driven by strength of our products on specialty crops.
We also had a shift of diamide partner sales to Latin America from North America, similar to what occurred in Q1, which boosted the year-over-year growth rate.
EMEA sales increased 3% year-over-year, but declined 3% organically as FX was a significant tailwind in the period.
Diamides grew well, and we saw strong sales of herbicides for cereals and sugar beets.
However, this wasn't enough to offset the late start of the spring, which resulted in lost applications for the FMC portfolio that will not be regained during the season.
In North America, sales decreased 7% year-over-year and 8% organically.
Similar to Q1, the year-over-year sales decline in Q2 was due to the shift of diamide partner sales from North America to other regions.
Excluding revenue from our global diamide partnerships, our U.S. and Canada crop business grew greater than 20%, driven by an approximate $25 million contribution from two new products, Xyway fungicide and Vantacor insect control for specialty crops.
Turning now to the second quarter EBITDA bridge on slide five.
EBITDA in the quarter was up 2% year-over-year due to the volume contribution of $42 million, largely offset by a $35 million cost headwind.
The cost headwind continues to be driven by increases in raw material, packaging and logistic costs and the very modest reversal of some of the temporary cost savings from 2020.
Pricing was essentially flat versus prior year.
Turning to our view of the overall market conditions for 2021.
We now expect the global crop protection market will be up mid-single digits on a U.S. dollar basis, which is slightly higher than our prior forecast and the most bullish we've been on the overall market for the past few years.
The reason for the change is our view that the Latin American market will now grow in the high single digits versus low single digits before.
Basic crop fundamentals remain strong, especially in that region.
We continue to anticipate mid-single-digit growth in the EMEA market, low to mid-single-digit growth in the Asian market and low single-digit growth in the North American market.
Turning to slide six and the review of FMC's full year 2021 and Q3, Q4 earnings outlook.
FMC full year 2021 earnings are now expected to be in the range of $6.54 to $6.94 per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 9% at the midpoint.
This is down $0.31 at the midpoint versus our prior forecast.
Consistent with past practice, we do not factor in any benefit from future potential share repurchases in our earnings per share guidance.
Our 2021 revenue forecast remains in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion, an increase of 8% at the midpoint versus 2020.
EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $1.29 billion to $1.35 billion, representing a 6% year-over-year growth at the midpoint.
This is a $50 million reduction at the midpoint compared to our prior forecast due to continued acceleration costs for raw materials, packaging and logistics.
This includes spending more to procure certain raw materials and intermediates from alternate sources where there is limited availability at our preferred suppliers.
Despite dry and cold conditions in certain parts of Brazil during Q2, we are bullish for the second half in Latin America, especially for soybeans and cotton.
In Brazil, our channel inventories are at more normal levels for this point in the season following the actions we took in Q1 this year.
And we already have received nearly 70% of the orders needed to deliver our full year forecast in Brazil.
Guidance for Q3 implies year-over-year sales growth of 8% at the midpoint on a reported basis and 7% organically.
We are forecasting EBITDA growth of 5% at the midpoint versus Q3 2020, and earnings per share is forecasted to be up 7% year-over-year.
Guidance for Q4 implies year-over-year sales growth of 20% at the midpoint on a reported basis with no FX impact anticipated.
We are forecasting EBITDA growth of 35% at the midpoint versus Q4 2020, and earnings per share is forecasted to be up 46% year-over-year.
It is worth noting that about half of this growth is going to be driven by the return of business we missed in Q4 2020 due to supply chain issues in North America and weather impact in Latin America.
Turning to slide seven and full year EBITDA and revenue drivers.
Revenue is expected to benefit from 6% volume growth, a 1% contribution from higher prices and a 1% benefit from FX.
We continue to expect broad growth across all regions except EMEA and a very strong second half of 2021.
We have raised our forecast for 2021 revenue contribution from products launched in the last 12 months to $130 million from $100 million before.
This includes launches of Overwatch herbicide, Xyway fungicide as well as Vantacor and Elevest insect controls.
Our EBITDA bridge shows an increase of about $50 million in the expected impact from costs versus our May forecast.
We continue our cost control actions to limit the net cost headwind.
As we stated throughout the year, the R&D spending in our forecast is what is needed to keep our projects on a critical path to commercialization.
But this year-over-year increase will be closer to $20 million rather than the $30 million to $40 million we had previously indicated as we limit overall cost increases.
Relative to our prior guidance bridge in May, we raised the anticipated volume contribution and lowered our benefit from pricing to reflect our decision to take volume with our high-margin portfolio.
Moving to slide eight, where you see the Q3 and Q4 drivers.
On the revenue line for the third quarter, we are expecting a 6% contribution from volume, 1% contribution from price and 1% benefit from FX.
We had a very strong revenue outlook for Q4, driven by five main elements.
First, we forecast a strong recovery for our U.S. and Brazil businesses following the weak Q4 2020 in those countries.
This contributes about half of the total growth in the quarter.
Second, new products will be a major factor.
Xyway fungicide, new diamide formulations Elevest and Vantacor, Fluindapyr fungicide for noncrop applications in the U.S., Overwatch herbicide in Australia and Authority NXT herbicide in India.
Third, strong crop fundamentals.
We expect a strong Q4 in North America and Latin America, driven by good fundamentals for a variety of crops.
In Brazil, this includes cotton, as growers have indicated a 15% increase in hectares for the upcoming season.
Fourth, improved market access and expansion into new geographies and crops.
This is having a significant impact in India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Eastern Europe and Russia.
And finally, fifth, price increases will help offset the FX headwind from last year and the higher costs from raw materials this year.
We are already holding orders for Brazil and U.S. that are at higher year-over-year prices.
Much of our forecasted Q4 EBITDA growth will come directly from the volume and pricing growth I just described.
Although we are seeing a large increase in cost in Q4 on a year-over-year basis, we are taking actions to reduce SG&A and R&D to offset a portion of the raw material and supply chain cost headwinds we are facing.
FX was a stronger-than-expected tailwind to revenue growth in the quarter at 4% versus our expectations of a 1% tailwind as the U.S. dollar weakened against all major currencies relevant to FMC.
Interest expense for the quarter was $32.6 million, down $8.1 million from the prior year period driven by the benefit of lower LIBOR rates and lower foreign debt balances.
With continued low interest rates, we now expect interest expense to be between $130 million and $135 million for the full year.
Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the second quarter was 13.5% as anticipated and in line with our continued expectation for the full year tax rate.
Moving next to the balance sheet and liquidity.
Gross debt at quarter end was $3.8 billion, up roughly $200 million from the prior quarter.
Gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was 3.2 times at the end of the second quarter, while net debt to EBITDA was 2.6 times.
The difference between gross debt and net debt metric is much larger than usual this quarter as we had significant cash that we were not able to return to the United States prior to quarter end.
We are exploring repatriation alternatives for this cash in the third quarter.
Both levered metrics were above our targeted full year average leverage levels due to seasonality of working capital and will improve through the remainder of the year.
Moving on to slide nine and cash flow and cash deployment.
Free cash flow for the second quarter was $204 million, essentially flat to the prior year period.
Adjusted cash from operations was lower than the prior year period, in large part due to timing changes of certain tax payments.
Inventory was higher, reflecting the accelerating cost of raw materials as well as increased inventory levels, particularly of diamide, as we prepare for a very strong second half.
However, the growth in inventory was offset by increased payables.
Capital additions were somewhat higher as we continue to ramp up spending following deferral of projects last year due to COVID.
Legacy and transformation spending was down substantially with the benefit of the completion of our SAP program.
With the reduction in our outlook for full year EBITDA, we are similarly adjusting downward our expectations for free cash flow to a range of $480 million to $570 million, with the vast majority of this cash flow coming in the fourth quarter.
Our outlook for adjusted cash from operations has weakened further the EBITDA, driven by somewhat higher-than-expected working capital due to shifts in timing of sales to the latter part of the second half of the year, which will shift some collections into the following year, as well as higher inventory driven partially by elevated raw material costs.
Our outlook for capital additions as well as for legacy and transformation have improved slightly.
We returned $87 million to shareholders in the quarter via $62 million in dividends and $25 million of share repurchases, buying back 212,000 shares in the quarter at an average price of $118.10 per share.
Year-to-date, we've returned $224 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchases.
For the full year, we continue to anticipate paying dividends of roughly $250 million, and now expect to repurchase a total of $350 million to $450 million of FMC shares this year, with the outlook for repurchases down slightly, reflecting the lower EBITDA guidance.
And with that, I'll hand the call back to Mark.
Today, we'll provide an update on the progress of our diamide growth strategy.
Since we launched FMC as a pure-play agricultural science company, diamides have been a core part of our business.
Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr have grown to be almost 40% of FMC sales today.
Turning to slide 11 and some basic data on the insecticides market, which has grown by 83% from 2007 to 2019 and is approximately $17 billion in value today.
Following the broad crop protection market drop in 2015, insecticides have grown 2% per year.
We expect this to accelerate in the next decade to about 3.3% compound annual growth rate, as higher-value technologies take more share from older insecticides that are being phased out by regulators.
We believe by 2030, the insecticide market will expand by about $7 billion versus 2019 to $24 billion in total.
Moving to slide 12.
We show the year-by-year revenue of the major insecticide active ingredient classes from 2014 through 2019, as reported by AgbioInvestor, and the respective share gains and losses over the period.
FMC diamides Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr make up well over 80% of the entire diamides class, which includes a few other smaller active ingredients.
Our diamides have grown to be about 10% to 11% of the total insecticide market, and the total diamides class has gained 2% share from 2017 to 2019 to reach 13% of the total insecticide market.
Conversely, organophosphates and neonicotinoids have lost overall share.
Turning to slide 13.
We show the geographic breakdown of our $1.8 billion in diamide sales in 2020.
This is all Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr sales and includes FMC sales of branded products and sales to our partners.
Asia makes up nearly 40% of our diamides business today with North America a little over 1/4 of the sales and EMEA and Latin America between 15% and 20% each.
FMC diamides have grown well above the market in all regions since we acquired them in 2017.
On the right is the crop breakdown for our diamides.
It should be no surprise that fruit and vegetables and rice make up about 50% of our current revenues.
This is why the diamides are so strong in Asia, since that market is about 30% rice and 30% fruit and vegetables.
Turning to slide 14 and our diamides commercial strategy, which we've discussed many times over the past two years.
We have long-term supply agreements with five key multinational companies, including the UPL deal we announced in March of this year.
We also have 50 local agreements in various countries, and we have another 15 potential agreements currently under discussion.
These agreements are helping significantly expand the market for our diamides.
Our partners give us access to customers we do not currently serve.
They also have access to certain active ingredients that can be formulated with our diamide to expand the market beyond what FMC has access to.
The $1.8 billion diamide revenue in 2020 was roughly 60% through our own commercial activities, which we label as FMC branded on these charts and 40% through our global and local partners.
Since we acquired these products, our diamide growth has been evenly split between FMC-branded business and sales to our partners, which demonstrates how complementary these two routes to market are.
We've been very deliberate in driving our growth through our partnership model.
The success of this model is shown by the fact that the company EBITDA margins expanded 100 basis points from 2018 to 2020, even as these partners were growing significantly, confirming this strategy is not margin dilutive.
The other aspect to having sales to partners represent $700 million of our annual revenue can add more volatility in timing of demand.
As such, revenues can be impacted by shifts in partner demand across the geographies and in time periods.
We have structured the contracts with partners to have extended duration.
Many of the agreements go through the end of this decade and some go beyond that time frame.
Moving to slide 15.
There are several highlights of how we have grown our FMC-branded portion of our diamide sales.
New formulations, new registrations, label extensions and improved market access will drive growth not only for the diamides but for all FMC active ingredients.
Earlier this year, we launched the novel patent-pending Vantacor formulation in the U.S., which has already exceeded our original forecast.
Vantacor provides a much higher concentration than prior Rynaxypyr formulation, offering improved mixing, less packaging and an improved sustainability profile.
We see compelling opportunities in several crops and plan to launch Vantacor around the world, including Australia, where we have just received regulatory approval.
We will continue to introduce other new mixtures and innovative formulations in all regions with 11 more launches expected by 2026.
We are also developing new products' offerings for our patented PrecisionPac and 3RIVE 3D systems, which are expected to launch during the next five years.
Furthermore, we continue to expand our precision agricultural platform with additional services provided to growers and dealers through Arc Farm Intelligence.
Moving to slide 16, where we provide an update on our registrations and label extension strategy for our FMC-branded diamides.
A product registration from regulators is required in every country where we wish to sell, and each specific crop to be treated must be further approved by the regulators in that country.
Every product use approved by regulators equals a new slice of addressable market.
Today, we have approximately 2,700 approved uses across all products based on Rynaxypyr, and 1,100 across all products based on Cyazypyr.
We currently have 600 regulatory submissions under review and another 230 that we plan to submit to regulators from 2021 to 2025.
We anticipate nearly 600 of these will achieve regulatory approval in the next five years.
Moving to slide 17 and the diamide patent state.
Rynaxypyr is covered by 21 patent families with a total of 639 granted and pending patents.
Together with Cyazypyr active related patents, we have over 30 patent families and close to 1,000 granted and pending patents filed in 76 countries worldwide.
Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr are complex molecules to produce.
We have patented many of these steps and several of these intermediate processes patents run well past the expiration of the active ingredient composition of matter patents.
The fastest route to market for a competitor to enter the market for generic Rynaxypyr or Cyazypyr is to register their product by relying on FMC's product data.
To do so, they will also be required to demonstrate that their product has the same profile as FMC's Rynaxypyr or Cyazypyr.
To meet these stringent regulatory requirements for such difficult-to-manufacture molecules, the AIs will have to be made the same way we are making it, which is protected by our FMC process patents.
Our patent portfolio includes extensive coverage of key intermediate chemicals, commercial and alternative manufacturing processes, mixtures and formulations.
slides 18 and 19 show the patent time lines for the top five markets.
Taking into account our patents and regulatory requirements, we do not expect to see sales by a legitimate generic competitor that uses the approved manufacturing process, which would rely on our Rynaxypyr product data before 2026 in Europe, Brazil, India or in China, and 2027 for the U.S. Using that same approach for Cyazypyr on slide 19, we do not expect to see sales by legitimate generic competitors until 2026 for Brazil, China and India, 2027 for Europe, and 2028 for the U.S.
It is important to note that process and intermediate patents are critical as it is extremely difficult to produce these compounds without these intermediates.
Moving to slide 20.
We are confident that our patent portfolio is impossible.
This is evident in a recent favorable injunction, restraining NATCO in India from making or selling any product containing Rynaxypyr.
Notably, the court also ordered NATCO not to use our patented processes to make Rynaxypyr.
We anticipate that this is the first of many successful enforcements of our diamide process patents.
To date, we have enforced our patents and obtained preliminary injunctions or settlements against six infringers in India, and we have commenced litigation against four infringers in China.
Beyond patent enforcement, we've also had a variety of other successful court decisions that support our strategy.
For example, we have obtained an injunction against the Brazilian regulators to respect our Rynaxypyr data exclusivity, which will postpone action on all generic Rynaxypyr applications filed while our data exclusivity was still in force.
This effectively delays their registration approval by years.
In addition to our legal strategy, we have also adopted a comprehensive regulatory advocacy strategy that includes notifying regulators about companies that do not have permission to produce.
As a result of these efforts, multiple countries have decided not to accept applications for registration of Rynaxypyr products prior to the active ingredients' patent expiration and others have decided to require additional data and proof of legitimate manufacturing rights in the source country as part of the application process.
So to recap on the diamides.
First, the insecticide market continues to grow, and our diamides will continue to take share.
Second, our partner strategy is accelerating the growth of diamides and smoothing the transition to a post-patent business later this decade.
Third, our patent state is strong and will remain in place for a long time.
Fourth, we are successfully defending our patents and we'll continue to enforce our IP.
And fifth, diamides will continue to be a meaningful contributor to FMC's growth throughout this decade and beyond.
Our mid- to long-term growth story is firmly rooted in the strength of our current portfolio, the diamide expansion we just outlined and the significant growth we anticipate from our new product pipeline over the next decade.
This is a bold step for our company and reflects our deep commitment to sustainability.

Turning to our Q2 results on slide three.
We reported $1.2 billion in second quarter revenue, which reflects an 8% increase on a reported basis and a 4% increase organically.
Asia and Latin America posted the largest growth of 20% and 15%, respectively.
Our fungicides grew over 50% in the quarter, driven by the Xyway launch in the U.S., and fungicides represented 8% of total sales in Q2 versus 5% of our sales in the prior year period.
Adjusted EBITDA was $347 million, an increase of 2% compared to the prior year period and $2 million above the midpoint of our guidance range.
EBITDA margins were 28%, a decrease of 150 basis points compared to the prior year, reflecting the impact of continued and accelerating cost headwinds.
Adjusted earnings were $1.81 per diluted share in the quarter, an increase of 5% versus Q2 2020 and also $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance range.
The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by the increases in EBITDA and lower interest expense.
Moving now to slide four.
Despite the unfavorable weather conditions in several regions, Q2 revenue increased by 8% versus the prior year, driven by a 4% volume increase and a 4% tailwind from foreign currencies.
Pricing was essentially flat year-over-year.
Sales in Asia increased 20% year-over-year and 13% organically, driven by double-digit growth in India, Australia, Indonesia and Pakistan.
Insecticides contributed the greatest growth, including Altacor for cotton, and herbicide sales were also very strong, driven by share gains in India for soybean and sugarcane applications as well as robust sales in Australia.
In Latin America, sales increased 15% year-over-year and 12% organically.
Mexico and Colombia each posted double-digit growth, driven by strength of our products on specialty crops.
We also had a shift of diamide partner sales to Latin America from North America, similar to what occurred in Q1, which boosted the year-over-year growth rate.
EMEA sales increased 3% year-over-year, but declined 3% organically as FX was a significant tailwind in the period.
Diamides grew well, and we saw strong sales of herbicides for cereals and sugar beets.
However, this wasn't enough to offset the late start of the spring, which resulted in lost applications for the FMC portfolio that will not be regained during the season.
In North America, sales decreased 7% year-over-year and 8% organically.
Similar to Q1, the year-over-year sales decline in Q2 was due to the shift of diamide partner sales from North America to other regions.
Excluding revenue from our global diamide partnerships, our U.S. and Canada crop business grew",17,"Mark will review our second quarter results, provide our outlook for the remainder of 2021 and discuss our diamides business.
Andrew will provide an overview of select financial items.
Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's understanding.
Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties.
Today's discussion and the supporting materials will include references to adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cash from operations, free cash flow and organic revenue growth, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures.
Please note that as used in today's discussion, earnings means adjusted earnings and EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA.
A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call are provided on our website.
Our second quarter results, revenue up 8%, EBITDA up 2% and earnings per share up 5% year-over-year were slightly ahead of our guidance.
These results were fundamentally driven by volume, reflecting robust demand for FMC products around the world.
Innovation continues to be a catalyst for growth.
New products introduced in the last 12 months contributed $30 million in sales growth in the quarter and our plant health products, including biologicals, posted Q2 sales growth in the high teens.
We continue to expect a very strong second half of 2021, driven by robust volume growth.
We have lowered our full year earnings guidance due to the continued acceleration of raw material, packaging and logistics costs.
We will go into this in more details later.
I'd like to take a moment to provide a COVID-19 update on our business.
All our manufacturing facilities and distribution warehouses remain operational and properly staffed.
Our research laboratories and greenhouses also have continued to operate throughout the pandemic.
We are resuming in-office operations work permitted by local authorities.
And in June, we introduced flexible work arrangements to facilitate the return of all our staff to our headquarters in Philadelphia as well as some other locations in adherence with local guidelines.
Turning to our Q2 results on slide three.
We reported $1.2 billion in second quarter revenue, which reflects an 8% increase on a reported basis and a 4% increase organically.
Asia and Latin America posted the largest growth of 20% and 15%, respectively.
Our fungicides grew over 50% in the quarter, driven by the Xyway launch in the U.S., and fungicides represented 8% of total sales in Q2 versus 5% of our sales in the prior year period.
Adjusted EBITDA was $347 million, an increase of 2% compared to the prior year period and $2 million above the midpoint of our guidance range.
EBITDA margins were 28%, a decrease of 150 basis points compared to the prior year, reflecting the impact of continued and accelerating cost headwinds.
Adjusted earnings were $1.81 per diluted share in the quarter, an increase of 5% versus Q2 2020 and also $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance range.
The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by the increases in EBITDA and lower interest expense.
Moving now to slide four.
Despite the unfavorable weather conditions in several regions, Q2 revenue increased by 8% versus the prior year, driven by a 4% volume increase and a 4% tailwind from foreign currencies.
Pricing was essentially flat year-over-year.
Sales in Asia increased 20% year-over-year and 13% organically, driven by double-digit growth in India, Australia, Indonesia and Pakistan.
Insecticides contributed the greatest growth, including Altacor for cotton, and herbicide sales were also very strong, driven by share gains in India for soybean and sugarcane applications as well as robust sales in Australia.
In Latin America, sales increased 15% year-over-year and 12% organically.
Mexico and Colombia each posted double-digit growth, driven by strength of our products on specialty crops.
We also had a shift of diamide partner sales to Latin America from North America, similar to what occurred in Q1, which boosted the year-over-year growth rate.
EMEA sales increased 3% year-over-year, but declined 3% organically as FX was a significant tailwind in the period.
Diamides grew well, and we saw strong sales of herbicides for cereals and sugar beets.
However, this wasn't enough to offset the late start of the spring, which resulted in lost applications for the FMC portfolio that will not be regained during the season.
In North America, sales decreased 7% year-over-year and 8% organically.
Similar to Q1, the year-over-year sales decline in Q2 was due to the shift of diamide partner sales from North America to other regions.
Excluding revenue from our global diamide partnerships, our U.S. and Canada crop business grew greater than 20%, driven by an approximate $25 million contribution from two new products, Xyway fungicide and Vantacor insect control for specialty crops.
Turning now to the second quarter EBITDA bridge on slide five.
EBITDA in the quarter was up 2% year-over-year due to the volume contribution of $42 million, largely offset by a $35 million cost headwind.
The cost headwind continues to be driven by increases in raw material, packaging and logistic costs and the very modest reversal of some of the temporary cost savings from 2020.
Pricing was essentially flat versus prior year.
Turning to our view of the overall market conditions for 2021.
We now expect the global crop protection market will be up mid-single digits on a U.S. dollar basis, which is slightly higher than our prior forecast and the most bullish we've been on the overall market for the past few years.
The reason for the change is our view that the Latin American market will now grow in the high single digits versus low single digits before.
Basic crop fundamentals remain strong, especially in that region.
We continue to anticipate mid-single-digit growth in the EMEA market, low to mid-single-digit growth in the Asian market and low single-digit growth in the North American market.
Turning to slide six and the review of FMC's full year 2021 and Q3, Q4 earnings outlook.
FMC full year 2021 earnings are now expected to be in the range of $6.54 to $6.94 per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 9% at the midpoint.
This is down $0.31 at the midpoint versus our prior forecast.
Consistent with past practice, we do not factor in any benefit from future potential share repurchases in our earnings per share guidance.
Our 2021 revenue forecast remains in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion, an increase of 8% at the midpoint versus 2020.
EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $1.29 billion to $1.35 billion, representing a 6% year-over-year growth at the midpoint.
This is a $50 million reduction at the midpoint compared to our prior forecast due to continued acceleration costs for raw materials, packaging and logistics.
This includes spending more to procure certain raw materials and intermediates from alternate sources where there is limited availability at our preferred suppliers.
Despite dry and cold conditions in certain parts of Brazil during Q2, we are bullish for the second half in Latin America, especially for soybeans and cotton.
In Brazil, our channel inventories are at more normal levels for this point in the season following the actions we took in Q1 this year.
And we already have received nearly 70% of the orders needed to deliver our full year forecast in Brazil.
Guidance for Q3 implies year-over-year sales growth of 8% at the midpoint on a reported basis and 7% organically.
We are forecasting EBITDA growth of 5% at the midpoint versus Q3 2020, and earnings per share is forecasted to be up 7% year-over-year.
Guidance for Q4 implies year-over-year sales growth of 20% at the midpoint on a reported basis with no FX impact anticipated.
We are forecasting EBITDA growth of 35% at the midpoint versus Q4 2020, and earnings per share is forecasted to be up 46% year-over-year.
It is worth noting that about half of this growth is going to be driven by the return of business we missed in Q4 2020 due to supply chain issues in North America and weather impact in Latin America.
Turning to slide seven and full year EBITDA and revenue drivers.
Revenue is expected to benefit from 6% volume growth, a 1% contribution from higher prices and a 1% benefit from FX.
We continue to expect broad growth across all regions except EMEA and a very strong second half of 2021.
We have raised our forecast for 2021 revenue contribution from products launched in the last 12 months to $130 million from $100 million before.
This includes launches of Overwatch herbicide, Xyway fungicide as well as Vantacor and Elevest insect controls.
Our EBITDA bridge shows an increase of about $50 million in the expected impact from costs versus our May forecast.
We continue our cost control actions to limit the net cost headwind.
As we stated throughout the year, the R&D spending in our forecast is what is needed to keep our projects on a critical path to commercialization.
But this year-over-year increase will be closer to $20 million rather than the $30 million to $40 million we had previously indicated as we limit overall cost increases.
Relative to our prior guidance bridge in May, we raised the anticipated volume contribution and lowered our benefit from pricing to reflect our decision to take volume with our high-margin portfolio.
Moving to slide eight, where you see the Q3 and Q4 drivers.
On the revenue line for the third quarter, we are expecting a 6% contribution from volume, 1% contribution from price and 1% benefit from FX.
We had a very strong revenue outlook for Q4, driven by five main elements.
First, we forecast a strong recovery for our U.S. and Brazil businesses following the weak Q4 2020 in those countries.
This contributes about half of the total growth in the quarter.
Second, new products will be a major factor.
Xyway fungicide, new diamide formulations Elevest and Vantacor, Fluindapyr fungicide for noncrop applications in the U.S., Overwatch herbicide in Australia and Authority NXT herbicide in India.
Third, strong crop fundamentals.
We expect a strong Q4 in North America and Latin America, driven by good fundamentals for a variety of crops.
In Brazil, this includes cotton, as growers have indicated a 15% increase in hectares for the upcoming season.
Fourth, improved market access and expansion into new geographies and crops.
This is having a significant impact in India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Eastern Europe and Russia.
And finally, fifth, price increases will help offset the FX headwind from last year and the higher costs from raw materials this year.
We are already holding orders for Brazil and U.S. that are at higher year-over-year prices.
Much of our forecasted Q4 EBITDA growth will come directly from the volume and pricing growth I just described.
Although we are seeing a large increase in cost in Q4 on a year-over-year basis, we are taking actions to reduce SG&A and R&D to offset a portion of the raw material and supply chain cost headwinds we are facing.
FX was a stronger-than-expected tailwind to revenue growth in the quarter at 4% versus our expectations of a 1% tailwind as the U.S. dollar weakened against all major currencies relevant to FMC.
Interest expense for the quarter was $32.6 million, down $8.1 million from the prior year period driven by the benefit of lower LIBOR rates and lower foreign debt balances.
With continued low interest rates, we now expect interest expense to be between $130 million and $135 million for the full year.
Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the second quarter was 13.5% as anticipated and in line with our continued expectation for the full year tax rate.
Moving next to the balance sheet and liquidity.
Gross debt at quarter end was $3.8 billion, up roughly $200 million from the prior quarter.
Gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was 3.2 times at the end of the second quarter, while net debt to EBITDA was 2.6 times.
The difference between gross debt and net debt metric is much larger than usual this quarter as we had significant cash that we were not able to return to the United States prior to quarter end.
We are exploring repatriation alternatives for this cash in the third quarter.
Both levered metrics were above our targeted full year average leverage levels due to seasonality of working capital and will improve through the remainder of the year.
Moving on to slide nine and cash flow and cash deployment.
Free cash flow for the second quarter was $204 million, essentially flat to the prior year period.
Adjusted cash from operations was lower than the prior year period, in large part due to timing changes of certain tax payments.
Inventory was higher, reflecting the accelerating cost of raw materials as well as increased inventory levels, particularly of diamide, as we prepare for a very strong second half.
However, the growth in inventory was offset by increased payables.
Capital additions were somewhat higher as we continue to ramp up spending following deferral of projects last year due to COVID.
Legacy and transformation spending was down substantially with the benefit of the completion of our SAP program.
With the reduction in our outlook for full year EBITDA, we are similarly adjusting downward our expectations for free cash flow to a range of $480 million to $570 million, with the vast majority of this cash flow coming in the fourth quarter.
Our outlook for adjusted cash from operations has weakened further the EBITDA, driven by somewhat higher-than-expected working capital due to shifts in timing of sales to the latter part of the second half of the year, which will shift some collections into the following year, as well as higher inventory driven partially by elevated raw material costs.
Our outlook for capital additions as well as for legacy and transformation have improved slightly.
We returned $87 million to shareholders in the quarter via $62 million in dividends and $25 million of share repurchases, buying back 212,000 shares in the quarter at an average price of $118.10 per share.
Year-to-date, we've returned $224 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchases.
For the full year, we continue to anticipate paying dividends of roughly $250 million, and now expect to repurchase a total of $350 million to $450 million of FMC shares this year, with the outlook for repurchases down slightly, reflecting the lower EBITDA guidance.
And with that, I'll hand the call back to Mark.
Today, we'll provide an update on the progress of our diamide growth strategy.
Since we launched FMC as a pure-play agricultural science company, diamides have been a core part of our business.
Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr have grown to be almost 40% of FMC sales today.
Turning to slide 11 and some basic data on the insecticides market, which has grown by 83% from 2007 to 2019 and is approximately $17 billion in value today.
Following the broad crop protection market drop in 2015, insecticides have grown 2% per year.
We expect this to accelerate in the next decade to about 3.3% compound annual growth rate, as higher-value technologies take more share from older insecticides that are being phased out by regulators.
We believe by 2030, the insecticide market will expand by about $7 billion versus 2019 to $24 billion in total.
Moving to slide 12.
We show the year-by-year revenue of the major insecticide active ingredient classes from 2014 through 2019, as reported by AgbioInvestor, and the respective share gains and losses over the period.
FMC diamides Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr make up well over 80% of the entire diamides class, which includes a few other smaller active ingredients.
Our diamides have grown to be about 10% to 11% of the total insecticide market, and the total diamides class has gained 2% share from 2017 to 2019 to reach 13% of the total insecticide market.
Conversely, organophosphates and neonicotinoids have lost overall share.
Turning to slide 13.
We show the geographic breakdown of our $1.8 billion in diamide sales in 2020.
This is all Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr sales and includes FMC sales of branded products and sales to our partners.
Asia makes up nearly 40% of our diamides business today with North America a little over 1/4 of the sales and EMEA and Latin America between 15% and 20% each.
FMC diamides have grown well above the market in all regions since we acquired them in 2017.
On the right is the crop breakdown for our diamides.
It should be no surprise that fruit and vegetables and rice make up about 50% of our current revenues.
This is why the diamides are so strong in Asia, since that market is about 30% rice and 30% fruit and vegetables.
Turning to slide 14 and our diamides commercial strategy, which we've discussed many times over the past two years.
We have long-term supply agreements with five key multinational companies, including the UPL deal we announced in March of this year.
We also have 50 local agreements in various countries, and we have another 15 potential agreements currently under discussion.
These agreements are helping significantly expand the market for our diamides.
Our partners give us access to customers we do not currently serve.
They also have access to certain active ingredients that can be formulated with our diamide to expand the market beyond what FMC has access to.
The $1.8 billion diamide revenue in 2020 was roughly 60% through our own commercial activities, which we label as FMC branded on these charts and 40% through our global and local partners.
Since we acquired these products, our diamide growth has been evenly split between FMC-branded business and sales to our partners, which demonstrates how complementary these two routes to market are.
We've been very deliberate in driving our growth through our partnership model.
The success of this model is shown by the fact that the company EBITDA margins expanded 100 basis points from 2018 to 2020, even as these partners were growing significantly, confirming this strategy is not margin dilutive.
The other aspect to having sales to partners represent $700 million of our annual revenue can add more volatility in timing of demand.
As such, revenues can be impacted by shifts in partner demand across the geographies and in time periods.
We have structured the contracts with partners to have extended duration.
Many of the agreements go through the end of this decade and some go beyond that time frame.
Moving to slide 15.
There are several highlights of how we have grown our FMC-branded portion of our diamide sales.
New formulations, new registrations, label extensions and improved market access will drive growth not only for the diamides but for all FMC active ingredients.
Earlier this year, we launched the novel patent-pending Vantacor formulation in the U.S., which has already exceeded our original forecast.
Vantacor provides a much higher concentration than prior Rynaxypyr formulation, offering improved mixing, less packaging and an improved sustainability profile.
We see compelling opportunities in several crops and plan to launch Vantacor around the world, including Australia, where we have just received regulatory approval.
We will continue to introduce other new mixtures and innovative formulations in all regions with 11 more launches expected by 2026.
We are also developing new products' offerings for our patented PrecisionPac and 3RIVE 3D systems, which are expected to launch during the next five years.
Furthermore, we continue to expand our precision agricultural platform with additional services provided to growers and dealers through Arc Farm Intelligence.
Moving to slide 16, where we provide an update on our registrations and label extension strategy for our FMC-branded diamides.
A product registration from regulators is required in every country where we wish to sell, and each specific crop to be treated must be further approved by the regulators in that country.
Every product use approved by regulators equals a new slice of addressable market.
Today, we have approximately 2,700 approved uses across all products based on Rynaxypyr, and 1,100 across all products based on Cyazypyr.
We currently have 600 regulatory submissions under review and another 230 that we plan to submit to regulators from 2021 to 2025.
We anticipate nearly 600 of these will achieve regulatory approval in the next five years.
Moving to slide 17 and the diamide patent state.
Rynaxypyr is covered by 21 patent families with a total of 639 granted and pending patents.
Together with Cyazypyr active related patents, we have over 30 patent families and close to 1,000 granted and pending patents filed in 76 countries worldwide.
Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr are complex molecules to produce.
We have patented many of these steps and several of these intermediate processes patents run well past the expiration of the active ingredient composition of matter patents.
The fastest route to market for a competitor to enter the market for generic Rynaxypyr or Cyazypyr is to register their product by relying on FMC's product data.
To do so, they will also be required to demonstrate that their product has the same profile as FMC's Rynaxypyr or Cyazypyr.
To meet these stringent regulatory requirements for such difficult-to-manufacture molecules, the AIs will have to be made the same way we are making it, which is protected by our FMC process patents.
Our patent portfolio includes extensive coverage of key intermediate chemicals, commercial and alternative manufacturing processes, mixtures and formulations.
slides 18 and 19 show the patent time lines for the top five markets.
Taking into account our patents and regulatory requirements, we do not expect to see sales by a legitimate generic competitor that uses the approved manufacturing process, which would rely on our Rynaxypyr product data before 2026 in Europe, Brazil, India or in China, and 2027 for the U.S. Using that same approach for Cyazypyr on slide 19, we do not expect to see sales by legitimate generic competitors until 2026 for Brazil, China and India, 2027 for Europe, and 2028 for the U.S.
It is important to note that process and intermediate patents are critical as it is extremely difficult to produce these compounds without these intermediates.
Moving to slide 20.
We are confident that our patent portfolio is impossible.
This is evident in a recent favorable injunction, restraining NATCO in India from making or selling any product containing Rynaxypyr.
Notably, the court also ordered NATCO not to use our patented processes to make Rynaxypyr.
We anticipate that this is the first of many successful enforcements of our diamide process patents.
To date, we have enforced our patents and obtained preliminary injunctions or settlements against six infringers in India, and we have commenced litigation against four infringers in China.
Beyond patent enforcement, we've also had a variety of other successful court decisions that support our strategy.
For example, we have obtained an injunction against the Brazilian regulators to respect our Rynaxypyr data exclusivity, which will postpone action on all generic Rynaxypyr applications filed while our data exclusivity was still in force.
This effectively delays their registration approval by years.
In addition to our legal strategy, we have also adopted a comprehensive regulatory advocacy strategy that includes notifying regulators about companies that do not have permission to produce.
As a result of these efforts, multiple countries have decided not to accept applications for registration of Rynaxypyr products prior to the active ingredients' patent expiration and others have decided to require additional data and proof of legitimate manufacturing rights in the source country as part of the application process.
So to recap on the diamides.
First, the insecticide market continues to grow, and our diamides will continue to take share.
Second, our partner strategy is accelerating the growth of diamides and smoothing the transition to a post-patent business later this decade.
Third, our patent state is strong and will remain in place for a long time.
Fourth, we are successfully defending our patents and we'll continue to enforce our IP.
And fifth, diamides will continue to be a meaningful contributor to FMC's growth throughout this decade and beyond.
Our mid- to long-term growth story is firmly rooted in the strength of our current portfolio, the diamide expansion we just outlined and the significant growth we anticipate from our new product pipeline over the next decade.
This is a bold step for our company and reflects our deep commitment to sustainability.

"
18,"Today's call will cover ITT's financial results for the three months period ending July 3, announced yesterday evening.
These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations.
Actual results may vary materially, due to, among other items, the factors described in our 2020 Annual Report, on Form 10-K and other recent SEC filings.
These adjusted results exclude certain non-operating and non-recurring items, including but not limited to asbestos-related charges, restructuring, asset impairment, acquisition-related items and certain tax items.
Before we begin, I'll provide a brief overview of our second quarter GAAP results.
Revenue increased 34% to $692 million.
Segment operating income increased 206% [Phonetic] to $114 million, which equates to segment operating margin of 16.5%.
Reported earnings per share decreased 15% to $0.45, driven primarily by a $28 million after-tax loss on the divestiture of InTelCo Management LLC, formerly a wholly owned subsidiary that holds legacy asbestos liabilities and related insurance assets, as well as prior-year income tax benefits, and increased corporate and environmental costs.
We are all focused on ensuring ITT delivers on its commitments hour after hour, while taking care of each other, our families, and our customers.
This has been a pivotal quarter for ITT.
On July 1, we divested a subsidiary that holds all of our legacy asbestos liabilities to a portfolio company of Warburg Pincus.
Importantly, ITT is indemnified from any further responsibility for all pending and future legacy asbestos claims.
This transaction follows the successful transfer of our U.S. pension liability in October 2020 and will allow us to focus more on growing the core business organically and through acquisitions.
We are now beginning the next chapter in ITT's history.
On the operational front, over the past few months, I've had the privilege of meeting our teams in person at our sites in Italy, California, the Netherlands, and the Northeast.
I continue to be encouraged by the progress we are making, by the opportunities that remain, and by the commitment and the passion I see from our workforce.
Before reviewing our results, let me talk a little bit about ITT's sustainability efforts.
In the coming weeks, we will be releasing our 2021 Sustainability Report Supplement, which will show our commitment to environmental, social, and governance initiatives.
It is clear that while we have made significant progress in 2020 despite the impact of the pandemic, there is still more that we can do.
Our employees' efforts during the pandemic to take care of each other and our customers have strengthened our resolve to continuously improve our ESG practices and this is what we will do.
Some of our accomplishments, which you can soon read about it in the supplement, include a 25% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a 25% reduction in workplace incidents.
Further, we maintained an A rating for our ESG profile, as measured by MSCI, a recognized leader in global ESG assessment.
Now, let's review our results for the second quarter, beginning with sales.
Friction continued to outperform global auto production growth.
In fact, the outperformance we drove this quarter was significantly above our historical average.
The auto businesses in MT grew organic revenue nearly 80% and MT's revenue exceeded pre-COVID levels from 2019 once again this quarter.
More importantly, we continue to win key awards in both conventional vehicles and our new electric vehicle platforms, which will fuel future outperformance.
This quarter we were awarded content on 10 new electric vehicle platforms, seven of which were in China and two on key strategic platforms in the growing North American market.
We also continue to differentiate ourselves from the competition.
In July, Friction's outer ceramic brake pads sold in the aftermarket were ranked the highest among five competitors according to ADAC, Europe's largest motoring association based in Germany.
This is a testament to the supplier excellence and innovation of the Friction team.
Let's get back to the quarter.
Building on the first quarter momentum, our connectors business in Connect and Control Technologies grew sales by 17% organically, after 8% organic in Q1.
We saw continued strength in the North American distribution channel; and sequentially, industrial connectors in Q2 grew 6% versus Q1, due to distribution strength worldwide.
We also drove 8% organic revenue growth in Industrial Process, driven by strong pump project deliveries, which were up 52% organically in the quarter due to strength in the chemical and oil and gas markets.
We achieved this by remaining focused on serving our customers and ensuring we commission their projects on time, despite significant supply chain disruptions.
Turning to orders, I'm energized by the growth our commercial teams generated this quarter across all three segments.
In total, we drove 47% organic orders growth across ITT with order levels surpassing 2019, positioning us well for the second half of the year and for 2022.
First, Motion Technologies grew orders by 76% organically, driven mainly by auto, and we also saw a strong performance in valve [Phonetic], which grew over 20% organically.
Second, in Industrial Process, orders were up 18% organically and up 7% sequentially, driven by continued recovery in our short-cycle business, where orders grew 24% across parts, valves and service.
Our pump project orders were relatively flat year-over-year.
However, we are increasingly confident that project activity in the funnel is strengthening and we expect to successfully leverage this momentum in the second half.
Finally, in CCT, orders were up 47% organically, driven largely by industrial connectors and aerospace components.
As we mentioned last quarter, we saw some positive signs in commercial aerospace, which we expect it will start to pick up in Q2, and we are seeing the momentum in orders today.
From a profitability perspective, despite increasing pressure from commodity costs and supply chain disruptions, we delivered nearly 400 basis points of adjusted segment margin expansion, with triple-digit margin expansion in each segment.
This was a result of the incredible growth in volumes, I mentioned earlier, and the team's ability to generate productivity, net of inflation, while successfully navigating challenging market conditions.
This was aided in part by the actions we took in 2020 to reduce our structural costs.
As a result of the revenue growth and margin expansion, ITT delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.94, growing 65% and surpassing our pre-COVID adjusted earnings per share levels in Q2 2019.
Given the strong first-half performance and our confidence in ITT's ability to outperform, we are again raising our outlook for 2021.
We now anticipate organic revenue growth will be 8% to 10% for the year, a 300 basis point increase on both the low- and high-end of our already increased guidance from the first quarter.
These will be driven by the strength in Friction, and short-cycle orders growth in both IP and CCT.
The increased sales volume and strong productivity expected in 2021 will generate adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.90 to $4.05 at the high end, which equates to 22% to 27% growth versus prior year.
This is an $0.08 improvement at the midpoint, after a $0.30 increase after the first quarter, and this puts ITT on pace to comfortably surpass 2018 adjusted earnings per share despite significant inflationary pressure.
From a top line perspective, Motion Technologies delivered a solid performance, driven by strong growth in the OE business and continued share gains despite the global chip shortage and supply chain disruptions.
Our Friction and Wolverine OE businesses grew over 60% organically.
As I always do, this quarter, I traveled to a number of our facilities, including our world-class friction plant in Barge, Italy.
Here, I saw the teams' engineering expertise on full display, which will enable us to continue winning an outsized share of global EV platforms.
Our continued investment in automation in all our plants and hour-by-hour management allows us to continuously meet customer demand, despite constantly changing production schedules; and we continue to invest in and develop new technologies to address the needs of a new and more environmentally friendly automotive braking system.
In CCT, we drove nearly 19% organic revenue growth in industrial connectors, mainly through distribution, continuing the momentum we saw in the first quarter.
Demand in commercial aerospace is increasing, exhibited by the nearly 70% growth in aerospace orders.
The book to bill in CCT was an impressive 1.18 for the quarter, which positions us well for the future.
Now, moving to operating margins.
Our focus on operational excellence produced 250 basis points of expansion in Q2 at the ITT level and 390 basis points at the segment level.
By segment, MT grew margin 660 basis points, Connect and Control 230 basis points with an incremental margin of 37%, and Industrial Process grew margin 100 basis points to nearly 15% once again.
The strong performance was a combination of higher sales volume, commercial actions and productivity, offset by raw material inflation and unfavorable mix, given the growth in pump projects and continued investments for growth, which are critical to sustain ITT's outperformance.
Regarding raw materials' inflation, the impact this quarter was approximately 240 basis points, which was higher than what we expected.
And while we are deploying pricing actions with our customers, based on current prices for material purchases for the remainder of 2021, we expect this phenomenon will have a significant impact in the second half.
Free cash flow for the quarter was impacted by the sale of our legacy asbestos liabilities.
Excluding this one-time non-recurring item, adjusted free cash flow was $131 million.
The decline compared to prior year was the result of higher operating income generation in the segments that was more than offset by strategic investments in working capital to support growing customer demand.
Wrapping up, our ITTans [Phonetic] around the world delivered another outstanding performance in Q2.
Organic growth was strong across all three segments and we converted to higher sales at good margins.
We generated over 400 basis points of productivity while investing for future growth and successfully navigated challenging market conditions; and our nearly 50% organic growth in orders position ITT for a strong second half.
Motion Technologies' Q2 organic revenue growth of 64% was primarily driven by strength in auto.
As you know, the second quarter of last year was down significantly, due to the pandemic.
However, Friction continued to outperform global auto production by a very wide margin.
And from an operating standpoint, our OE business performed very well, with 99%-plus on-time performance.
This was a key reason MT's revenue eclipsed pre-COVID levels in the second quarter of 2019 by 8%.
The strong orders growth in MT, this quarter, was a combination of both auto and valve, where we continue to gain share.
Segment margin expanded 660 basis points versus prior year to 18.8%, mainly due to higher volumes and productivity, offset by the impact of higher raw material costs for steel, tin, and copper.
As we indicated last year, MT's margins declined sequentially in the second quarter, given the increasing commodities pressure.
However, MT delivered almost 30% incremental margin, in spite of these headwinds.
Wolverine sales growth was over 60%, driven by OE shims in North America and Europe, and in sealings, while KONI grew by double digits organically.
Margins in Wolverine, KONI and Axtone were all double digits in the quarter.
For Industrial Process, revenue was up 8% organically.
This was driven partially by an easy prior-year comparison, stemming from steep declines in project shipments, which resulted in over 50% revenue growth this quarter.
We also saw minor short-cycle declines, driven by lower service sales and flat growth in baseline pumps, due to the materials' shortage.
As we have indicated, given the order trends we see across IP, we continue to expect the short-cycle businesses to accelerate in the second half.
From an end market perspective, growth was spread across general industrial, oil and gas, and chemical markets.
IP grew 18% organically and 7% sequentially, due to the short cycle; namely, parts, valves and service.
Our daily order rates continue to be strong into the third quarter.
Orders in all product categories, except baseline pumps, were above 2019 levels, and the month of June was our largest month of project orders since 2015.
We believe this positions us well for the remainder of 2021.
IP's margin expanded 100 basis points to 14.7%, with an incremental margin of 24%.
This was partially impacted by unfavorable mix, given the higher proportion of project versus short-cycle sales.
We expect the mix to improve from here as short cycle continues to recover.
Lastly, in Connect and Control Technologies, we continued to turn the corner with incremental margins of 37% this quarter.
This was the result of continued volume leverage and strong productivity, despite inflationary headwinds and continued declines in commercial aerospace, while OE production continues to improve our largest aerospace customers and managing through elevated inventory levels on key platforms which will delay a significant recovery in aero components demand until 2022.
Similar to the rest of ITT, orders growth was incredibly strong, driven by our connector business, with continued North American distribution strength and growth in aerospace OE and aftermarket.
The book to bill was largely above 1 and backlog was up 16% compared to year-end 2020, which again position us well heading into 2022.
Before we move on, just a few additional comments on earnings per share for the quarter.
As you can see on the Q2 adjusted earnings per share walk on Slide 11, the year-over-year comparisons were negatively impacted by prior-year benefits, related to environmental, temporary cost actions, and CARES Act credits.
Partially offsetting these items was a roughly $0.03 benefit from foreign currency, consistent with our outlook, and a roughly $0.01 benefit from a lower-than-planned effective tax rate of 21.5%.
On July 1, ITT divested 100% of its equity of a subsidiary that holds legacy asbestos liabilities and related insurance assets to Delticus, a portfolio company of Warburg Pincus.
At closing, ITT contributed $398 million in cash and Delticus contributed $60 million in cash to InTelCo.
As a result of the transaction, ITT removed all asbestos obligations, related insurance assets, and associated deferred tax assets from our consolidated balance sheet as of the second quarter.
The benefits of this transaction include the indemnification for all legacy asbestos liabilities and stronger free cash flow generation in the absence of asbestos-related payments that we previously estimated at $20 million to $30 million per year on average over the next 10 years, prior to the divestiture.
Additionally, the transaction freeze up management time and resources to focus more on growing the core business and executing other more strategic initiatives, including ESG and M&A.
Coupled with our successful U.S. pension plans transfer executed in October 2020, we are well positioned to grow with a flexible balance sheet and without the risks and uncertainty of managing these legacy liabilities.
As we saw in Friction's results, global auto production is increasing, albeit constrained by the global semiconductor shortage which is causing inventory levels to remain low.
And while we expect demand will remain strong throughout 2021, the impact of higher raw material prices will weigh on margins and adjusted earnings per share during the second half.
The growth we're seeing in IP orders is mainly in short cycle.
On projects, however, we continue to expect the large project spend, particularly in oil and gas, will not fully recover until 2022.
In the meantime, we're seeing continued momentum in weekly run rates in our short-cycle businesses in Industrial Process and connectors, which we believe will drive organic revenue growth to a new range of 8% to 10% for the year.
Our assumption regarding commercial aerospace is that a substantial recovery will not occur until early 2022, given the level of inventory at our largest OE customers.
However, we see encouraging signs in orders, as production levels continue to increase.
Our outlook for adjusted segment margin remains at approximately 17.1% at the midpoint.
We expect a pronounced impact from raw material inflation, mainly in Motion Technologies.
However, our teams are driving commercial actions and additional productivity to minimize the impact.
We're planning for raw materials to remain at these elevated levels throughout 2021.
As you will see on Slide 7, our revised guidance assuming the incremental impact from this trend will be $0.09 at the high-end for the remainder of 2021.
Our revised adjusted earnings per share guidance reflects an $0.08 improvement at the midpoint of our range, eclipsing 2019 levels and our previous high end.
The net impact of all other items is roughly $0.01 benefit to full-year adjusted EPS, including a slightly lower-than-planned effective tax rate.
Foreign currency and other items will be a minor benefit, compared to our previous guidance.
And we continue to expect a 1% reduction in the weighted average share count, given our share repurchases to date.
Additionally, we are raising our adjusted free cash flow guidance by $5 million at the low- and high-ends of our previous range to reflect the higher operating income generated in the first half, offset by further working capital investments to support future growth, especially given the supply chain disruptions we are experiencing today.
In summary, we are again raising our outlook for 2021 across sales, earnings and free cash flow.
And with this raise, we now expect to eclipse 2019 levels in terms of adjusted segment margin and adjusted earnings per share.
As you can see, the majority of the improvement in adjusted earnings per share is operational in nature.
The higher volumes will likely be partially offset by incremental headwinds from rising raw material costs, which we have already discussed; the remaining changes to our outlook are rather immaterial.
From an end market perspective, the trends we saw in the second quarter have remained largely consistent throughout July.
Auto and the short cycle businesses in IP continue to perform well and CCT remains comfortably on path to recovery from both a sales and margin perspective.
On the other hand, our outlook reflects increased commodity pressure and we do not see any near-term improvements related to the supply chain.
Organic sales growth is expected to be in the mid-teens range, driven by growth across the portfolio and led by MP's strong performance.
IP and CCT should both improve to approximately high-single-digit organic growth, driven by short cycle.
Segment margin should be approximately flat sequentially to Q2 and above prior year, even with the significant raw material headwinds we anticipate primarily in MT. This negative impact on MT's margin will largely be offset by margin improvements in CCT, followed by Industrial Process.
Despite the margin challenges in Q3, we still expect all three businesses to be up over 100 basis points for the full year, which will eclipse ITT's segment margin for 2019.
The combined impact of higher sales and strong productivity will drive adjusted earnings-per-share growth in the low- to mid-teens.
With that, let me pass it back to Luca for closing remarks.
ITT continues to execute on its strategic priorities to position the company for long-term success.
The actions we took to eliminate our legacy asbestos liabilities will allow our teams to drive better growth in the core and up our game in capital deployment.
We are now even more laser-focused on growing ITT organically and through acquisitions while funding high-return growth investments, given our capital flexibility and strengthened cash flow profile.
We continue to outperform across all our businesses and we see encouraging signs in our orders growth, which will position us well for the remainder of 2021, 2022 and beyond, and simultaneously [Phonetic] continue to drive strong cash generation through increased income and effective working capital management.
The second half of 2021 will be challenging, given the supply chain disruptions, commodities pressure and emergence of COVID variant around the world.
However, I'm confident in ITT's ability to navigate these headwinds effectively, and drive growth and profitability, while leveraging our optimized cost structure and doing it all in a safe sustainable and efficient manner.

",18,"Today's call will cover ITT's financial results for the three months period ending July 3, announced yesterday evening.
These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations.
Actual results may vary materially, due to, among other items, the factors described in our 2020 Annual Report, on Form 10-K and other recent SEC filings.
These adjusted results exclude certain non-operating and non-recurring items, including but not limited to asbestos-related charges, restructuring, asset impairment, acquisition-related items and certain tax items.
Before we begin, I'll provide a brief overview of our second quarter GAAP results.
Revenue increased 34% to $692 million.
Segment operating income increased 206% [Phonetic] to $114 million, which equates to segment operating margin of 16.5%.
Reported earnings per share decreased 15% to $0.45, driven primarily by a $28 million after-tax loss on the divestiture of InTelCo Management LLC, formerly a wholly owned subsidiary that holds legacy asbestos liabilities and related insurance assets, as well as prior-year income tax benefits, and increased corporate and environmental costs.
We are all focused on ensuring ITT delivers on its commitments hour after hour, while taking care of each other, our families, and our customers.
This has been a pivotal quarter for ITT.
On July 1, we divested a subsidiary that holds all of our legacy asbestos liabilities to a portfolio company of Warburg Pincus.
Importantly, ITT is indemnified from any further responsibility for all pending and future legacy asbestos claims.
This transaction follows the successful transfer of our U.S. pension liability in October 2020 and will allow us to focus more on growing the core business organically and through acquisitions.
We are now beginning the next chapter in ITT's history.
On the operational front, over the past few months, I've had the privilege of meeting our teams in person at our sites in Italy, California, the Netherlands, and the Northeast.
I continue to be encouraged by the progress we are making, by the opportunities that remain, and by the commitment and the passion I see from our workforce.
Before reviewing our results, let me talk a little bit about ITT's sustainability efforts.
In the coming weeks, we will be releasing our 2021 Sustainability Report Supplement, which will show our commitment to environmental, social, and governance initiatives.
It is clear that while we have made significant progress in 2020 despite the impact of the pandemic, there is still more that we can do.
Our employees' efforts during the pandemic to take care of each other and our customers have strengthened our resolve to continuously improve our ESG practices and this is what we will do.
Some of our accomplishments, which you can soon read about it in the supplement, include a 25% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a 25% reduction in workplace incidents.
Further, we maintained an A rating for our ESG profile, as measured by MSCI, a recognized leader in global ESG assessment.
Now, let's review our results for the second quarter, beginning with sales.
Friction continued to outperform global auto production growth.
In fact, the outperformance we drove this quarter was significantly above our historical average.
The auto businesses in MT grew organic revenue nearly 80% and MT's revenue exceeded pre-COVID levels from 2019 once again this quarter.
More importantly, we continue to win key awards in both conventional vehicles and our new electric vehicle platforms, which will fuel future outperformance.
This quarter we were awarded content on 10 new electric vehicle platforms, seven of which were in China and two on key strategic platforms in the growing North American market.
We also continue to differentiate ourselves from the competition.
In July, Friction's outer ceramic brake pads sold in the aftermarket were ranked the highest among five competitors according to ADAC, Europe's largest motoring association based in Germany.
This is a testament to the supplier excellence and innovation of the Friction team.
Let's get back to the quarter.
Building on the first quarter momentum, our connectors business in Connect and Control Technologies grew sales by 17% organically, after 8% organic in Q1.
We saw continued strength in the North American distribution channel; and sequentially, industrial connectors in Q2 grew 6% versus Q1, due to distribution strength worldwide.
We also drove 8% organic revenue growth in Industrial Process, driven by strong pump project deliveries, which were up 52% organically in the quarter due to strength in the chemical and oil and gas markets.
We achieved this by remaining focused on serving our customers and ensuring we commission their projects on time, despite significant supply chain disruptions.
Turning to orders, I'm energized by the growth our commercial teams generated this quarter across all three segments.
In total, we drove 47% organic orders growth across ITT with order levels surpassing 2019, positioning us well for the second half of the year and for 2022.
First, Motion Technologies grew orders by 76% organically, driven mainly by auto, and we also saw a strong performance in valve [Phonetic], which grew over 20% organically.
Second, in Industrial Process, orders were up 18% organically and up 7% sequentially, driven by continued recovery in our short-cycle business, where orders grew 24% across parts, valves and service.
Our pump project orders were relatively flat year-over-year.
However, we are increasingly confident that project activity in the funnel is strengthening and we expect to successfully leverage this momentum in the second half.
Finally, in CCT, orders were up 47% organically, driven largely by industrial connectors and aerospace components.
As we mentioned last quarter, we saw some positive signs in commercial aerospace, which we expect it will start to pick up in Q2, and we are seeing the momentum in orders today.
From a profitability perspective, despite increasing pressure from commodity costs and supply chain disruptions, we delivered nearly 400 basis points of adjusted segment margin expansion, with triple-digit margin expansion in each segment.
This was a result of the incredible growth in volumes, I mentioned earlier, and the team's ability to generate productivity, net of inflation, while successfully navigating challenging market conditions.
This was aided in part by the actions we took in 2020 to reduce our structural costs.
As a result of the revenue growth and margin expansion, ITT delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.94, growing 65% and surpassing our pre-COVID adjusted earnings per share levels in Q2 2019.
Given the strong first-half performance and our confidence in ITT's ability to outperform, we are again raising our outlook for 2021.
We now anticipate organic revenue growth will be 8% to 10% for the year, a 300 basis point increase on both the low- and high-end of our already increased guidance from the first quarter.
These will be driven by the strength in Friction, and short-cycle orders growth in both IP and CCT.
The increased sales volume and strong productivity expected in 2021 will generate adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.90 to $4.05 at the high end, which equates to 22% to 27% growth versus prior year.
This is an $0.08 improvement at the midpoint, after a $0.30 increase after the first quarter, and this puts ITT on pace to comfortably surpass 2018 adjusted earnings per share despite significant inflationary pressure.
From a top line perspective, Motion Technologies delivered a solid performance, driven by strong growth in the OE business and continued share gains despite the global chip shortage and supply chain disruptions.
Our Friction and Wolverine OE businesses grew over 60% organically.
As I always do, this quarter, I traveled to a number of our facilities, including our world-class friction plant in Barge, Italy.
Here, I saw the teams' engineering expertise on full display, which will enable us to continue winning an outsized share of global EV platforms.
Our continued investment in automation in all our plants and hour-by-hour management allows us to continuously meet customer demand, despite constantly changing production schedules; and we continue to invest in and develop new technologies to address the needs of a new and more environmentally friendly automotive braking system.
In CCT, we drove nearly 19% organic revenue growth in industrial connectors, mainly through distribution, continuing the momentum we saw in the first quarter.
Demand in commercial aerospace is increasing, exhibited by the nearly 70% growth in aerospace orders.
The book to bill in CCT was an impressive 1.18 for the quarter, which positions us well for the future.
Now, moving to operating margins.
Our focus on operational excellence produced 250 basis points of expansion in Q2 at the ITT level and 390 basis points at the segment level.
By segment, MT grew margin 660 basis points, Connect and Control 230 basis points with an incremental margin of 37%, and Industrial Process grew margin 100 basis points to nearly 15% once again.
The strong performance was a combination of higher sales volume, commercial actions and productivity, offset by raw material inflation and unfavorable mix, given the growth in pump projects and continued investments for growth, which are critical to sustain ITT's outperformance.
Regarding raw materials' inflation, the impact this quarter was approximately 240 basis points, which was higher than what we expected.
And while we are deploying pricing actions with our customers, based on current prices for material purchases for the remainder of 2021, we expect this phenomenon will have a significant impact in the second half.
Free cash flow for the quarter was impacted by the sale of our legacy asbestos liabilities.
Excluding this one-time non-recurring item, adjusted free cash flow was $131 million.
The decline compared to prior year was the result of higher operating income generation in the segments that was more than offset by strategic investments in working capital to support growing customer demand.
Wrapping up, our ITTans [Phonetic] around the world delivered another outstanding performance in Q2.
Organic growth was strong across all three segments and we converted to higher sales at good margins.
We generated over 400 basis points of productivity while investing for future growth and successfully navigated challenging market conditions; and our nearly 50% organic growth in orders position ITT for a strong second half.
Motion Technologies' Q2 organic revenue growth of 64% was primarily driven by strength in auto.
As you know, the second quarter of last year was down significantly, due to the pandemic.
However, Friction continued to outperform global auto production by a very wide margin.
And from an operating standpoint, our OE business performed very well, with 99%-plus on-time performance.
This was a key reason MT's revenue eclipsed pre-COVID levels in the second quarter of 2019 by 8%.
The strong orders growth in MT, this quarter, was a combination of both auto and valve, where we continue to gain share.
Segment margin expanded 660 basis points versus prior year to 18.8%, mainly due to higher volumes and productivity, offset by the impact of higher raw material costs for steel, tin, and copper.
As we indicated last year, MT's margins declined sequentially in the second quarter, given the increasing commodities pressure.
However, MT delivered almost 30% incremental margin, in spite of these headwinds.
Wolverine sales growth was over 60%, driven by OE shims in North America and Europe, and in sealings, while KONI grew by double digits organically.
Margins in Wolverine, KONI and Axtone were all double digits in the quarter.
For Industrial Process, revenue was up 8% organically.
This was driven partially by an easy prior-year comparison, stemming from steep declines in project shipments, which resulted in over 50% revenue growth this quarter.
We also saw minor short-cycle declines, driven by lower service sales and flat growth in baseline pumps, due to the materials' shortage.
As we have indicated, given the order trends we see across IP, we continue to expect the short-cycle businesses to accelerate in the second half.
From an end market perspective, growth was spread across general industrial, oil and gas, and chemical markets.
IP grew 18% organically and 7% sequentially, due to the short cycle; namely, parts, valves and service.
Our daily order rates continue to be strong into the third quarter.
Orders in all product categories, except baseline pumps, were above 2019 levels, and the month of June was our largest month of project orders since 2015.
We believe this positions us well for the remainder of 2021.
IP's margin expanded 100 basis points to 14.7%, with an incremental margin of 24%.
This was partially impacted by unfavorable mix, given the higher proportion of project versus short-cycle sales.
We expect the mix to improve from here as short cycle continues to recover.
Lastly, in Connect and Control Technologies, we continued to turn the corner with incremental margins of 37% this quarter.
This was the result of continued volume leverage and strong productivity, despite inflationary headwinds and continued declines in commercial aerospace, while OE production continues to improve our largest aerospace customers and managing through elevated inventory levels on key platforms which will delay a significant recovery in aero components demand until 2022.
Similar to the rest of ITT, orders growth was incredibly strong, driven by our connector business, with continued North American distribution strength and growth in aerospace OE and aftermarket.
The book to bill was largely above 1 and backlog was up 16% compared to year-end 2020, which again position us well heading into 2022.
Before we move on, just a few additional comments on earnings per share for the quarter.
As you can see on the Q2 adjusted earnings per share walk on Slide 11, the year-over-year comparisons were negatively impacted by prior-year benefits, related to environmental, temporary cost actions, and CARES Act credits.
Partially offsetting these items was a roughly $0.03 benefit from foreign currency, consistent with our outlook, and a roughly $0.01 benefit from a lower-than-planned effective tax rate of 21.5%.
On July 1, ITT divested 100% of its equity of a subsidiary that holds legacy asbestos liabilities and related insurance assets to Delticus, a portfolio company of Warburg Pincus.
At closing, ITT contributed $398 million in cash and Delticus contributed $60 million in cash to InTelCo.
As a result of the transaction, ITT removed all asbestos obligations, related insurance assets, and associated deferred tax assets from our consolidated balance sheet as of the second quarter.
The benefits of this transaction include the indemnification for all legacy asbestos liabilities and stronger free cash flow generation in the absence of asbestos-related payments that we previously estimated at $20 million to $30 million per year on average over the next 10 years, prior to the divestiture.
Additionally, the transaction freeze up management time and resources to focus more on growing the core business and executing other more strategic initiatives, including ESG and M&A.
Coupled with our successful U.S. pension plans transfer executed in October 2020, we are well positioned to grow with a flexible balance sheet and without the risks and uncertainty of managing these legacy liabilities.
As we saw in Friction's results, global auto production is increasing, albeit constrained by the global semiconductor shortage which is causing inventory levels to remain low.
And while we expect demand will remain strong throughout 2021, the impact of higher raw material prices will weigh on margins and adjusted earnings per share during the second half.
The growth we're seeing in IP orders is mainly in short cycle.
On projects, however, we continue to expect the large project spend, particularly in oil and gas, will not fully recover until 2022.
In the meantime, we're seeing continued momentum in weekly run rates in our short-cycle businesses in Industrial Process and connectors, which we believe will drive organic revenue growth to a new range of 8% to 10% for the year.
Our assumption regarding commercial aerospace is that a substantial recovery will not occur until early 2022, given the level of inventory at our largest OE customers.
However, we see encouraging signs in orders, as production levels continue to increase.
Our outlook for adjusted segment margin remains at approximately 17.1% at the midpoint.
We expect a pronounced impact from raw material inflation, mainly in Motion Technologies.
However, our teams are driving commercial actions and additional productivity to minimize the impact.
We're planning for raw materials to remain at these elevated levels throughout 2021.
As you will see on Slide 7, our revised guidance assuming the incremental impact from this trend will be $0.09 at the high-end for the remainder of 2021.
Our revised adjusted earnings per share guidance reflects an $0.08 improvement at the midpoint of our range, eclipsing 2019 levels and our previous high end.
The net impact of all other items is roughly $0.01 benefit to full-year adjusted EPS, including a slightly lower-than-planned effective tax rate.
Foreign currency and other items will be a minor benefit, compared to our previous guidance.
And we continue to expect a 1% reduction in the weighted average share count, given our share repurchases to date.
Additionally, we are raising our adjusted free cash flow guidance by $5 million at the low- and high-ends of our previous range to reflect the higher operating income generated in the first half, offset by further working capital investments to support future growth, especially given the supply chain disruptions we are experiencing today.
In summary, we are again raising our outlook for 2021 across sales, earnings and free cash flow.
And with this raise, we now expect to eclipse 2019 levels in terms of adjusted segment margin and adjusted earnings per share.
As you can see, the majority of the improvement in adjusted earnings per share is operational in nature.
The higher volumes will likely be partially offset by incremental headwinds from rising raw material costs, which we have already discussed; the remaining changes to our outlook are rather immaterial.
From an end market perspective, the trends we saw in the second quarter have remained largely consistent throughout July.
Auto and the short cycle businesses in IP continue to perform well and CCT remains comfortably on path to recovery from both a sales and margin perspective.
On the other hand, our outlook reflects increased commodity pressure and we do not see any near-term improvements related to the supply chain.
Organic sales growth is expected to be in the mid-teens range, driven by growth across the portfolio and led by MP's strong performance.
IP and CCT should both improve to approximately high-single-digit organic growth, driven by short cycle.
Segment margin should be approximately flat sequentially to Q2 and above prior year, even with the significant raw material headwinds we anticipate primarily in MT. This negative impact on MT's margin will largely be offset by margin improvements in CCT, followed by Industrial Process.
Despite the margin challenges in Q3, we still expect all three businesses to be up over 100 basis points for the full year, which will eclipse ITT's segment margin for 2019.
The combined impact of higher sales and strong productivity will drive adjusted earnings-per-share growth in the low- to mid-teens.
With that, let me pass it back to Luca for closing remarks.
ITT continues to execute on its strategic priorities to position the company for long-term success.
The actions we took to eliminate our legacy asbestos liabilities will allow our teams to drive better growth in the core and up our game in capital deployment.
We are now even more laser-focused on growing ITT organically and through acquisitions while funding high-return growth investments, given our capital flexibility and strengthened cash flow profile.
We continue to outperform across all our businesses and we see encouraging signs in our orders growth, which will position us well for the remainder of 2021, 2022 and beyond, and simultaneously [Phonetic] continue to drive strong cash generation through increased income and effective working capital management.
The second half of 2021 will be challenging, given the supply chain disruptions, commodities pressure and emergence of COVID variant around the world.
However, I'm confident in ITT's ability to navigate these headwinds effectively, and drive growth and profitability, while leveraging our optimized cost structure and doing it all in a safe sustainable and efficient manner.
Crystal, please open the line for Q&A.

"
19,"We have provided the user-controlled slides on our Investor Relations website.
We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, president and CEO; and Barry Hytinen, our EVP and CFO.
Today, we plan to share a number of key messages to help you better understand our performance, including how we have successfully navigated the COVID-19 pandemic, how we continue to execute on Project Summit and the resulting transformation across the organization, how we have accelerated momentum in our data center business, and how we are increasing our commitment to diversity and inclusion and other sustainability initiatives.
In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results.
We have included the reconciliation to these measures as required by Reg G in our supplemental financial information.
With that, Bill, would you please begin?
Let me start by saying I hope you and your families are safe and well.
As we close out a year, which has been marked by a first quarter, delivering near record growth growth to a remaining year where we had to manage headwinds from COVID, I want to take a few minutes to reflect on where we've been and where we're also going.
Whilst we are optimistic of the positive impact the rollout of vaccines will have, we continue to believe that 2021 will look similar to 2020, albeit in reverse in terms of the macroeconomic landscape.
However, 2020 was also a year where there was much to celebrate now, which came out of the creativity and resiliency demonstrated by our teams.
I couldn't be more proud of my fellow mountaineers around the world in terms of the way we responded to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In a phrase, we managed the crisis, the crisis didn't manage us.
We continue to serve our customers where throughout the depths of the crisis, more than 96% of our facilities remained open.
We maintained our focus on Project Summit, where we have increased our targeted sustained annual cost savings from $200 million to $375 million, and have already achieved over $200 million on an annual run rate by the end of 2020.
We accelerated our growth in data center with 58.5 megawatts of new leases announced in 2020 versus 16.9 megawatts in 2019.
We continued our investment in new products and innovation with a focus on supporting our customers' remote workforces.
These services led to growth in some of our digital solutions year on year of 8%, excluding FX.
And we continue to see good returns from our global strategic accounts organization and maintained our focus on shifting our culture as part of Project Summit to be one more in-tune with accelerating our revenue growth through new services and solutions.
This continued focus on expanding our service offerings to our customer base of 225,000 customers and organizations, in spite of COVID, has allowed us to guide to organic revenue growth of 2% to 6% in 2021, the highest level of our growth in the past decade.
This significant investment in innovation and new product development is supported by our purpose to be our customers' most trusted partner for protecting and unlocking the value of what matters most to them in innovative and socially responsible ways.
Our strategy is highlighted by an important balance between accelerating growth, driven by developing end-to-end solutions to help our customers unlock value from their content as well as sustaining growth in physical storage and data center.
In other words, being both the lock and this is key to many of our customers' physical and digital data assets.
The strategy is underpinned by our high-performance, customer-obsessed culture and our strong customer connection with not only 225,000 customers, but over 950 of the world's largest 1,000 companies.
It is not simply investment in products that has given us accelerated revenue growth but a deliberate focus on shifting our culture as part of Project Summit.
This shift in culture is also marked by a singular focus on our customers as our north star; an acceleration in our commitments around diversity and inclusion, not just because it is just, but also because it is a key to our strategic success in being a more creative and dynamic organization, which can deliver more value in tune with our customer needs; and an increase in our commitments to carbon neutrality.
2020 stars continue to secure renewable energy to meet the power needs of 100% of our data centers, even with the rapid increase in bookings in new facilities operating.
Some examples of our laser focus on how we have responded to our customers' needs in more creative ways, including processing these unemployment benefits to get them into the hands of people in need during the crisis and setting up 12 digital mail rooms around the globe for customers who didn't know how they were going to stay connected with their remote workforce.
In a phrase, we helped our customers when they needed it most.
What that all means to me is that we came out of 2020 stronger than ever, a company with a new sense of momentum that will also fuel both our top and bottom line growth.
For the next few minutes, allow me to illustrate for you what I mean by momentum.
If resilience was the word for 2020, growth is the word for 2021.
We're already seeing evidence of this growth in data centers, for example, and then expect this to continue.
As we have discussed before, we are also seeing good growth in digital solutions as well as physical storage, both from the continued durability of our records management business, together with an expanding consumer business and believe this growth should continue.
This change in revenue growth trajectory is a direct result of the investments we have made in new product areas, coupled with changes we have made in our commercial engine.
One of the fundamental changes we have made in our commercial approach is that we have invested in creating more time for our salespeople to engage differently with our strategic customers.
This extra time with customers has allowed us to uncover new revenue opportunities, not just for additional physical storage and new data center customers, but for digital services, which provides both greater visibility for doc data as well as driving much more value from data both physically and digitally.
As a result, you can see, both from our performance last year as well as the guidance we have provided today for 2021, our company is more and more seen by our customers as a real partner who, yes, protects and manages all their physical and digital assets, but also gives our customers the key to integrating their information, unlocking its value as well as accelerating their own digital transformation journey.
For 70 years, we've offered protection for the assets our customers value most.
We now more and more catalog, index, govern and manage complete information across physical and digital domains, securely storing what customers need, disposing of what they down and helping them unearth the insights that drive business transformation.
Let's now explore some exciting growth opportunities ahead of us.
These are areas where we see great opportunities for growth as we position ourselves to unlock greater value for our customers and include data centers, fine arts and entertainment services, consumer storage, secure IT asset disposition or SITAD, small and medium business, content service platform, or CSP, think of this as electronic content management or ECM on steroids and to secure offline storage for a highly secure air gap data storage for cost-effective protection against ransom attacks.
Let's go into a little bit more detail about a couple of these areas.
In data center, we have built a strong global platform with 15 operating facilities across three continents since 2017.
And we just announced an agreement, which once closed, will mark our entry into the very fast-growing Indian market through some of our investment in the Web Werks.
The total addressable market for our data centers globally is $20 billion, and is growing at over 10% for co-location or retail customers in over 40% for our hyperscale segment.
If you look at fine art storage and entertainment services, it's roughly a $2 billion market for both together.
And just two months ago, the L.A. Times wrote an article about our entertainment services business.
They called us the Fort Knox of Hollywood.
The article highlighted how we are driving a different level of growth in that business through not just storage, but how we facilitate more opportunities for the studios and artists in distributing their assets to viewers and listeners.
In consumer, we've grown the business in one year from about 2 million cubic feet of storage to more than 7 million cubic feet of storage, so 3x as big in just 12 months.
The total addressable market for consumer storage is more than $35 billion, and it is growing at about 5% to 6% per year.
I'd note that our segment focus is on valet storage, where our logistics expertise gives us strong competitive advantage as well as being a nice submarket, which represents a significant opportunity for future growth.
Our SITAD business has an addressable market of $10 billion, and we have seen strong growth in this business over the course of 2020.
More importantly, we have found that our strong heritage around data security and chain of custody is proving a differentiator as we recently took on the global responsibility for SITAD on behalf of two large financial institutions.
So hopefully, this helps you appreciate now why we are so excited about the growth opportunities as we look to 2021 and beyond.
Taken together, the seven areas I highlighted earlier represent a significant market opportunity for us.
Let me put some context around that.
If you look back to 2015, the total addressable market we competed in was $10 billion.
And on average, those markets had low growth rates.
Over the last five years, as we've listened to customers, built expertise and developed new products and solutions, the addressable market that we now compete in is over $80 billion, yes, $80 billion.
Additionally, those products and services that we've developed expertise in are growing at a 13% organic growth rate.
So not only has the addressable market for our expanded service has grown by over eight times, but these new areas have double-digit industry growth rates, which helps facilitate our entry.
Let me now shift gears and briefly review our performance in the fourth quarter and throughout 2020.
At a high level, we couldn't have been more pleased with the way our mountaineers navigated the challenging environment in 2020 brought on by COVID-19.
Throughout the pandemic, we were laser-focused on execution and then controlling those factors that we could, leading to outperformance against our own internal expectations through the last 3 quarters of 2020.
This resulted in continued strength in total storage rental revenue, which grew nearly 4% on a constant currency basis and 2.4% organically.
While service revenue declines continued to offset the solid storage growth, we grew adjusted EBITDA 1.3% when adjusting for some currency, and our margin expanded 110 basis points in 2020.
This, all in spite of total revenue being down $115 million due to service activity declines.
Our success is a reflection of our mountaineers' dedication, and most importantly, I have been inspired by the way our teams looked after both the physical and the mental health of each other as they also navigated the threats from COVID, both at work and at home.
Turning now to our physical storage business.
Total global organic volume was essentially flat compared to the third quarter.
Contributing to this was a 1.9 million cubic foot increase in consumer and adjacent businesses, offset by a similar decrease in records and information management volume.
For the full year, total global organic volume was also flat, which is a good outcome considering the environment in which we were operating.
This year, we expect total global organic volume to be flat to slightly up.
Looking more specifically at RIM organic volume, this was down 1.9 million cubic feet sequentially.
For the full year, organic volume declined 1.1%.
In our Global Digital Solutions business in 2020, and we were actually able to grow service revenue 8% year over year, excluding FX.
Despite the pandemic, our team grew revenue.
This goes back to the different mindset I mentioned earlier.
We see a further acceleration in our digital solutions business going into 2021 and expect to exceed about $300 million in revenue for the year.
Turning now to our Global Data Center segment.
The team had a phenomenal year, blowing its leasing targets out of the water quarter after quarter.
For the full year, we leased more than 58 megawatts remember, our target coming into 2020 was 15 to 20 megawatts.
I want to underscore that, that success was not just the result of leasing to hyperscalers.
We had very good commercial momentum in our core enterprise retail location business, which represented 12 megawatts of the 58 megawatts or close to 40% of our bookings, excluding Frankfurt.
We attracted 73 new logos to our platform during 2020, adding to our broad and diverse base of more than 1,300 data center customers.
This should enable us to strengthen our network ecosystem and increase the stickiness of our deployments.
We also had this busy year in terms of development with more than 10 megawatts commissioned across multiple data centers and geographies increasing our leasable megawatts to 130.
Our team is actively adding to our development pipeline to ensure we have the right capacity in the right markets to meet robust customer demand, and we are excited for the opportunities we see ahead of us in 2021, where we expect to end the year with over 170 leasable megawatts.
One of those opportunities is further expanding our data center footprint into our new fast-growing markets.
The data center market in India is projected to grow rapidly in the coming years, and India is the second largest telecommunications market in the world.
We are very excited to be an early mover into an emerging market where the demand is high and the supply is low.
Turning to Project Summit, we generated adjusted EBITDA benefits of $165 million in 2020, consistent with our most recent expectations and significantly ahead of our initial estimates of $80 million, reflecting strong execution in swift and decisive actions activity and I think -- that actions are early initiatives.
This gives us an exit rate of annual savings of over $200 million heading into 2021.
As you will hear from Barry in more detail, we are fully on track to recognize the estimated $375 million of adjusted EBITDA benefiting this year, and we are expecting as this -- and we are excited for the tangible benefits we will experience this year as we continue to enhance our technology and processes.
Before I wrap up, I'd like to provide a little more detail about our continued commitment to cut our carbon emissions I referenced earlier.
We were one of the first 100 or so corporations worldwide to have an ambitious carbon reduction goal approved by the science-based targets initiative as being aligned with the Paris Climate Accord.
Already then in 2019, we reported that our goal to cut 25% was more than doubled by delivering a 52% reduction six years sooner than our 2025 commitment.
As we did this while growing our global data center business, one of the most energy-intensive industries in the world.
We will continue to flex our innovation muscle around energy consumption as well as having introduced the Green Power Pass to our customers.
This is the first solution of its kind and allows us to pass the benefits of 100% renewable energy data center platform to our customers for them to use to meet their sustainability targets.
We are confident based upon the momentum we are building in this area that we can achieve 100% carbon neutrality well before 2050 in spite of our very rapidly growing data center business.
To summarize, I've never been more optimistic about our opportunities for growth at any other time in our history, even with the anticipated continued headwinds due to COVID impacting our traditional service areas.
And I've never been more proud of how we've behaved as an organization over the course of 2020 and through the pandemic.
We also went above and beyond for our customers and our teams and embrace new collaboration tools and change how we work.
Our mountaineers truly lived our values day in and day out.
I'm excited to be on this journey with you all, and I can't wait to see the future together.
In a challenging macro environment, our team delivered solid performance across each of our key financial metrics.
For the full year, revenue of $4.1 billion declined 2.7% on a reported basis, which includes a 100 basis point impact from foreign exchange.
Total organic revenue declined 3.3%.
Organic service revenue declined 12.8%, reflecting the continued COVID impact on some of our activity levels.
Despite the macro headwinds, total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.4%, driven by more than 2 points of revenue management.
On a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 1.3% year on year to $1.48 billion.
Reflecting the team's strong progress with Project Summit and revenue management, EBITDA margin expanded 110 basis points to 35.6%, representing the best margin performance in the company's history.
Importantly, we see opportunity for profitability to continue to expand this over time.
AFFO increased 2.4% to $888 million or $3.07 on a per share basis.
We have made some refinements to our non-GAAP measures, spurred by feedback from the investment community that some of our non-GAAP measures are difficult to compare to peers.
This includes changes to how we account for unconsolidated ventures, stock-based compensation and a portion of growth capital.
To ensure comparability and transparency, we have provided this -- our results on both the former and new methodology.
Of course, the prior method will be comparable to current consensus estimates.
For example, under our former methodology, full-year 2020 adjusted EBITDA was $1.45 billion, which compares to the current consensus of $1.446 billion.
More detail is available in our earnings slides and on our Investor Relations website.
And now turning to our results for the quarter, which are based on our updated non-GAAP definitions.
On a reported basis, revenue of $1.1 billion declined 1.8%, which includes a 40 basis point impact from foreign exchange.
Total organic revenue declined 3.4%.
Organic service revenue declined 12.1%.
Overall, we continue to see service declines moderate with the fourth quarter reflecting a modest improvement in service trends.
Our total organic storage rental revenue grew 1.7%, driven by revenue management.
Adjusted EBITDA was $374 million under both our new and former definition.
We exceeded the projections we shared on our last call as revenue trends, both in storage and service, were better than planned.
Fourth-quarter EBITDA reflects progress on our Summit transformation, revenue management, and favorable mix, offset by COVID-driven impacts to the business.
AFFO was $191 million or $0.66 on a per share basis, in line with our prior projections.
AFFO reflects an increase in recurring capex that have been deferred earlier in the year in higher cash taxes.
Turning to the segment performance, in the fourth quarter, our global RIM business had strong storage revenue growth, driven by volume growth in our faster-growing markets and revenue management.
This was offset by declines in service revenue, albeit at moderating levels compared to earlier in the year, leading to total organic revenue decline of 3.6%.
In our shred business, the combination of lower tonnage and an 8% decline in the paper price versus last year resulted in a net $3 million reduction in adjusted EBITDA.
While there's been a slight step-up in the index prices in January, recycled paper prices have remained low.
At recent levels, we anticipate paper prices will result in EBITDA headwind of slightly over $10 million in 2021.
We are pleased with the continued momentum in consumer storage business as it becomes a more meaningful contributor to our overall physical storage volume growth.
Global RIM adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 40 basis points, driven by revenue management and the Project Summit.
So, in the fourth quarter, we continue to see fixed cost deleverage as we ensure we are staffed to the appropriate level to fully support our customers.
We also had a step-up in facility expense as we invested in maintenance that we had delayed over the prior two quarters.
Taking a look at headline numbers for our Global Data Center business, full year bookings came in at 58.5 megawatts.
Excluding the full building lease in Frankfurt, we leased 31.5 megawatts, representing bookings growth of 26%.
Total revenue grew 9% year over year.
In 2021, we expect to lease 25 to 30 megawatts, which, at the midpoint, would result in more than 20% annual bookings growth.
We feel good about the state of our pipeline, both from a hyperscale perspective as well as our core retail colocation.
We project full year revenue growth in the range of low double digits to approaching mid-teens.
With our strong prior year bookings, we have good visibility to revenue.
For the first quarter, we expect growth rates similar to the fourth quarter as the bulk of our 2020 bookings commence in the second quarter and beyond.
Turning to Project Summit, as a reminder, we expect total program benefits of $375 million, of which we delivered $165 million in 2020.
We expect an additional $150 million benefit in 2021 with the balance in 2022.
This quarter, the team delivered $52 million of adjusted EBITDA benefit.
As to capital expenditures, in the fourth quarter, we invested $163 million, bringing the full year to $446 million, in line with our prior expectations.
In 2021, we expect total capital expenditures to be approximately $550 million, consisting of approximately $410 million of growth capex, of which we plan to allocate approximately $300 million to data center development.
We expect $140 million of recurring capex.
Turning to capital recycling.
In the fourth quarter, our program generated approximately $451 million of proceeds, which includes the Frankfurt data center joint venture we have mentioned last quarter.
And for the full year, our capital recycling program generated approximately $475 million.
I would like to call out the sale-leaseback transaction we announced in December, in which we sold a portfolio of 13 industrial facilities, generating gross proceeds of $358 million.
This portfolio was sold at a cap rate slightly below 4.5%.
This was a compelling opportunity for us to monetize a small portion of our owned industrial assets while effectively maintaining long-term control of the facilities through an initial 10-year lease with multiple renewal options, among other favorable terms.
So, on a leverage-neutral basis, this transaction freed up approximately $260 million of investable capital that we intend to redeploy into faster-growing areas, including our data center business.
We plan to make these investments in 2021, so our year-end net debt balance reflects these proceeds.
With a highly favorable market backdrop in the strong data center development pipeline, we are planning to continue the -- to recycle industrial assets.
In 2021, we are planning for $125 million of recycling.
Turning to the balance sheet.
At year-end, we had approximately $2 billion of liquidity.
We ended the year with net lease-adjusted leverage of 5.3 times, down from 5.7 times at year-end 2019.
The pro forma, excluding the investable proceeds from our leaseback, leverage would have been just slightly under 5.5 times.
As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term leverage range of 4.5 to 5.5 times.
For 2021, we expect to end the year within our target range near the high end.
With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early April.
As we have said before, we are fully committed to some of our dividend at this sustainable level.
Our long-term target for payout ratio is low to mid-60s as a percentage of AFFO.
Now to give you more details as to our outlook for 2021, we are pleased to reinstitute financial guidance reflecting the strength of our business, our team's strong execution and improved visibility.
And for the full-year 2021, we currently expect revenue of $4.325 billion to $4.475 billion.
We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.575 billion to $1.625 billion.
At the midpoint, this guidance represents revenue growth of 6% and EBITDA growth of 8%.
At the midpoint, our guidance implies about 75 basis points of EBITDA margin improvement year on year.
We expect AFFO to be in the range of $945 million to $995 million or $3.25 to $3.42 per share.
At the midpoint, this represents 9% growth for both metrics.
Our guidance assumes global physical volume will be flat to slightly positive, revenue management will be a significant benefit for us in 2021.
And I will note the majority of our actions have already been taken as we speak to you today, and nearly all of them will be in place by the end of the quarter as we are seeing in digital solutions, combined with a slight recovery in our service activity that's across the year.
In terms of EBITDA, our expectations include the benefit from revenue management and top line growth as well as Project Summit savings.
Partially offsetting those benefits is a prudent outlook for inflation, a step-up in cost from prior COVID-driven discretion, rent from some sale-leaseback transactions and innovation spend.
While we do not typically guide quarterly, with the pandemic, we felt it would be helpful to share our expectations for the first quarter.
And on a dollar basis, we expect revenue and adjusted EBITDA to be consistent to slightly up from the fourth-quarter results.
In summary, our team is executing well, visibility is improving, and our pipeline across our business has been strengthening over the last several months.
We feel well-positioned as we move into 2021.
I am confident in the team's ability to really continue to build our momentum.
And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.

We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, president and CEO; and Barry Hytinen, our EVP and CFO.
Today, we plan to share a number of key messages to help you better understand our performance, including how we have successfully navigated the COVID-19 pandemic, how we continue to execute on Project Summit and the resulting transformation across the organization, how we have accelerated momentum in our data center business, and how we are increasing our commitment to diversity and inclusion and other sustainability initiatives.
In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results.
We have included the reconciliation to these measures as required by Reg G in our supplemental financial information.
With that, Bill, would you please begin?
Let me start by saying I hope you and your families are safe and well.
As we close out a year, which has been marked by a first quarter, delivering near record growth growth to a remaining year where we had to manage headwinds from COVID, I want to take a few minutes to reflect on where we've been and where we're also going.
Whilst we are optimistic of the positive impact the rollout of vaccines will have, we continue to believe that 2021 will look similar to 2020, albeit in reverse in terms of the macroeconomic landscape.
However, 2020 was also a year where there was much to celebrate now, which came out of the creativity and resiliency demonstrated by our teams.
I couldn't be more proud of my fellow mountaineers around the world in terms of the way we responded to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In a phrase, we managed the crisis, the crisis didn't manage us.
We continue to serve our customers where throughout the depths of the crisis, more than 96% of our facilities remained open.
We maintained our focus on Project Summit, where we have increased our targeted sustained annual cost savings from $200 million to $375 million, and have already achieved over $200 million on an annual run rate by the end of 2020.
We accelerated our growth in data center with 58.5 megawatts of new leases announced in 2020 versus 16.9 megawatts in 2019.
We continued our investment in new products and innovation with a focus on supporting our customers' remote workforces.
These services led to growth in some of our digital solutions year on year of 8%, excluding FX.
And we continue to see good returns from our global strategic accounts organization and maintained our focus on shifting our culture as part of Project Summit to be one more in-tune with accelerating our revenue growth through new services and solutions.
This continued focus on expanding our service offerings to our customer base of 225,000 customers and organizations, in spite of COVID, has allowed us to guide to organic revenue growth of 2% to 6% in 2021, the highest level of our growth in the past decade.
This significant investment in innovation and new product development is supported by our purpose to be our customers' most trusted partner for protecting and unlocking the value of what matters most to them in innovative and socially responsible ways.
Our strategy is highlighted by an important balance between accelerating growth, driven by developing end-to-end solutions to help our customers unlock value from their content as well as sustaining growth in physical storage and data center.
In other words, being both the lock and this is key to many of our customers' physical and digital data assets.
The strategy is underpinned by our high-performance, customer-obsessed culture and our strong customer connection with not only 225,000 customers, but over 950 of the world's largest 1,000 companies.
It is not simply investment in products that has given us accelerated revenue growth but a deliberate focus on shifting our culture as part of Project Summit.
This shift in culture is also marked by a singular focus on our customers as our north star; an acceleration in our commitments around diversity and inclusion, not just because it is just, but also because it is a key to our strategic success in being a more creative and dynamic organization, which can deliver more value in tune with our customer needs; and an increase in our commitments to carbon neutrality.
2020 stars continue to secure renewable energy to meet the power needs of 100% of our data centers, even with the rapid increase in bookings in new facilities operating.
Some examples of our laser focus on how we have responded to our customers' needs in more creative ways, including processing these unemployment benefits to get them into the hands of people in need during the crisis and setting up 12 digital mail rooms around the globe for customers who didn't know how they were going to stay connected with their remote workforce.
In a phrase, we helped our customers when they needed it most.
What that all means to me is that we came out of 2020 stronger than ever, a company with a new sense of momentum that will also fuel both our top and bottom line growth.
For the next few minutes, allow me to illustrate for you what I mean by momentum.
If resilience was the word for 2020, growth is the word for 2021.
We're already seeing evidence of this growth in data centers, for example, and then expect this to continue.
As we have discussed before, we are also seeing good growth in digital solutions as well as physical storage, both from the continued durability of our records management business, together with an expanding consumer business and believe this growth should continue.
This change in revenue growth trajectory is a direct result of the investments we have made in new product areas, coupled with changes we have made in our commercial engine.
One of the fundamental changes we have made in our commercial approach is that we have invested in creating more time for our salespeople to engage differently with our strategic customers.
This extra time with customers has allowed us to uncover new revenue opportunities, not just for additional physical storage and new data center customers, but for digital services, which provides both greater visibility for doc data as well as driving much more value from data both physically and digitally.
As a result, you can see, both from our performance last year as well as the guidance we have provided today for 2021, our company is more and more seen by our customers as a real partner who, yes, protects and manages all their physical and digital assets, but also gives our customers the key to integrating their information, unlocking its value as well as accelerating their own digital transformation journey.
For 70 years, we've offered protection for the assets our customers value most.
We now more and more catalog, index, govern and manage complete information across physical and digital domains, securely storing what customers need, disposing of what they down and helping them unearth the insights that drive business transformation.
Let's now explore some exciting growth opportunities ahead of us.
These are areas where we see great opportunities for growth as we position ourselves to unlock greater value for our customers and include data centers, fine arts and entertainment services, consumer storage, secure IT asset disposition or SITAD, small and medium business, content service platform, or CSP, think of this as electronic content management or ECM on steroids and to secure offline storage for a highly secure air gap data storage for cost-effective protection against ransom attacks.
Let's go into a little bit more detail about a couple of these areas.
In data center, we have built a strong global platform with 15 operating facilities across three continents since 2017.
And we just announced an agreement, which once closed, will mark our entry into the very fast-growing Indian market through some of our investment in the Web Werks.
The total addressable market for our data centers globally is $20 billion, and is growing at over 10% for co-location or retail customers in over 40% for our hyperscale segment.
If you look at fine art storage and entertainment services, it's roughly a $2 billion market for both together.
And just two months ago, the L.A. Times wrote an article about our entertainment services business.
They called us the Fort Knox of Hollywood.
The article highlighted how we are driving a different level of growth in that business through not just storage, but how we facilitate more opportunities for the studios and artists in distributing their assets to viewers and listeners.
In consumer, we've grown the business in one year from about 2 million cubic feet of storage to more than 7 million cubic feet of storage, so 3x as big in just 12 months.
The total addressable market for consumer storage is more than $35 billion, and it is growing at about 5% to 6% per year.
I'd note that our segment focus is on valet storage, where our logistics expertise gives us strong competitive advantage as well as being a nice submarket, which represents a significant opportunity for future growth.
Our SITAD business has an addressable market of $10 billion, and we have seen strong growth in this business over the course of 2020.
More importantly, we have found that our strong heritage around data security and chain of custody is proving a differentiator as we recently took on the global responsibility for SITAD on behalf of two large financial institutions.
So hopefully, this helps you appreciate now why we are so excited about the growth opportunities as we look to 2021 and beyond.
Taken together, the seven areas I highlighted earlier represent a significant market opportunity for us.
Let me put some context around that.
If you look back to 2015, the total addressable market we competed in was $10 billion.
And on average, those markets had low growth rates.
Over the last five years, as we've listened to customers, built expertise and developed new products and solutions, the addressable market that we now compete in is over $80 billion, yes, $80 billion.
Additionally, those products and services that we've developed expertise in are growing at a 13% organic growth rate.
So not only has the addressable market for our expanded service has grown by over eight times, but these new areas have double-digit industry growth rates, which helps facilitate our entry.
Let me now shift gears and briefly review our performance in the fourth quarter and throughout 2020.
At a high level, we couldn't have been more pleased with the way our mountaineers navigated the challenging environment in 2020 brought on by COVID-19.
Throughout the pandemic, we were laser-focused on execution and then controlling those factors that we could, leading to outperformance against our own internal expectations through the last 3 quarters of 2020.
This resulted in continued strength in total storage rental revenue, which grew nearly 4% on a constant currency basis and 2.4% organically.
While service revenue declines continued to offset the solid storage growth, we grew adjusted EBITDA 1.3% when adjusting for some currency, and our margin expanded 110 basis points in 2020.
This, all in spite of total revenue being down $115 million due to service activity declines.
Our success is a reflection of our mountaineers' dedication, and most importantly, I have been inspired by the way our teams looked after both the physical and the mental health of each other as they also navigated the threats from COVID, both at work and at home.
Turning now to our physical storage business.
Total global organic volume was essentially flat compared to the third quarter.
Contributing to this was a 1.9 million cubic foot increase in consumer and adjacent businesses, offset by a similar decrease in records and information management volume.
For the full year, total global organic volume was also flat, which is a good outcome considering the environment in which we were operating.
This year, we expect total global organic volume to be flat to slightly up.
Looking more specifically at RIM organic volume, this was down 1.9 million cubic feet sequentially.
For the full year, organic volume declined 1.1%.
In our Global Digital Solutions business in 2020, and we were actually able to grow service revenue 8% year over year, excluding FX.
Despite the pandemic, our team grew revenue.
This goes back to the different mindset I mentioned earlier.
We see a further acceleration in our digital solutions business going into 2021 and expect to exceed about $300 million in revenue for the year.
Turning now to our Global Data Center segment.
The team had a phenomenal year, blowing its leasing targets out of the water quarter after quarter.
For the full year, we leased more than 58 megawatts remember, our target coming into 2020 was 15 to 20 megawatts.
I want to underscore that, that success was not just the result of leasing to hyperscalers.
We had very good commercial momentum in our core enterprise retail location business, which represented 12 megawatts of the 58 megawatts or close to 40% of our bookings, excluding Frankfurt.
We attracted 73 new logos to our platform during 2020, adding to our broad and diverse base of more than 1,300 data center customers.
This should enable us to strengthen our network ecosystem and increase the stickiness of our deployments.
We also had this busy year in terms of development with more than 10 megawatts commissioned across multiple data centers and geographies increasing our leasable megawatts to 130.
Our team is actively adding to our development pipeline to ensure we have the right capacity in the right markets to meet robust customer demand, and we are excited for the opportunities we see ahead of us in 2021, where we expect to end the year with over 170 leasable megawatts.
One of those opportunities is further expanding our data center footprint into our new fast-growing markets.
The data center market in India is projected to grow rapidly in the coming years, and India is the second largest telecommunications market in the world.
We are very excited to be an early mover into an emerging market where the demand is high and the supply is low.
Turning to Project Summit, we generated adjusted EBITDA benefits of $165 million in 2020, consistent with our most recent expectations and significantly ahead of our initial estimates of $80 million, reflecting strong execution in swift and decisive actions activity and I think -- that actions are early initiatives.
This gives us an exit rate of annual savings of over $200 million heading into 2021.
As you will hear from Barry in more detail, we are fully on track to recognize the estimated $375 million of adjusted EBITDA benefiting this year, and we are expecting as this -- and we are excited for the tangible benefits we will experience this year as we continue to enhance our technology and processes.
Before I wrap up, I'd like to provide a little more detail about our continued commitment to cut our carbon emissions I referenced earlier.
We were one of the first 100 or so corporations worldwide to have an ambitious carbon reduction goal approved by the science-based targets initiative as being aligned with the Paris Climate Accord.
Already then in 2019, we reported that our goal to cut 25% was more than doubled by delivering a 52% reduction six years sooner than our 2025 commitment.
As we did this while growing our global data center business, one of the most energy-intensive industries in the world.
We will continue to flex our innovation muscle around energy consumption as well as having introduced the Green Power Pass to our customers.
This is the first solution of its kind and allows us to pass the benefits of 100% renewable energy data center platform to our customers for them to use to meet their sustainability targets.
We are confident based upon the momentum we are building in this area that we can achieve 100% carbon neutrality well before 2050 in spite of our very rapidly growing data center business.
To summarize, I've never been more optimistic about our opportunities for growth at any other time in our history, even with the anticipated continued headwinds due to COVID impacting our traditional service areas.
And I've never been more proud of how we've behaved as an organization over the course of 2020 and through the pandemic.
We also went above and beyond for our customers and our teams and embrace new collaboration tools and change how we work.
Our mountaineers truly lived our values day in and day out.
I'm excited to be on this journey with you all, and I can't wait to see the future together.
In a challenging macro environment, our team delivered solid performance across each of our key financial metrics.
For the full year, revenue of $4.1 billion declined 2.7% on a reported basis, which includes a 100 basis point impact from foreign exchange.
Total organic revenue declined 3.3%.
Organic service revenue declined 12.8%, reflecting the continued COVID impact on some of our activity levels.
Despite the macro headwinds, total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.4%, driven by more than 2 points of revenue management.
On a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 1.3% year on year to $1.48 billion.
Reflecting the team's strong progress with Project Summit and revenue management, EBITDA margin expanded 110 basis points to 35.6%, representing the best margin performance in the company's history.
Importantly, we see opportunity for profitability to continue to expand this over time.
AFFO increased 2.4% to $888 million or $3.07 on a per share basis.
We have made some refinements to our non-GAAP measures, spurred by feedback from the investment community that some of our non-GAAP measures are difficult to compare to peers.
This includes changes to how we account for unconsolidated ventures, stock-based compensation and a portion of growth capital.
To ensure comparability and transparency, we have provided this -- our results on both the former and new methodology.
Of course, the prior method will be comparable to current consensus estimates.
For example, under our former methodology, full-year 2020 adjusted EBITDA was $1.45 billion, which compares to the current consensus of $1.446 billion.
More detail is available in our earnings slides and on our Investor Relations website.
And now turning to our results for the quarter, which are based on our updated non-GAAP definitions.
On a reported basis, revenue of $1.1 billion declined 1.8%, which includes a 40 basis point impact from foreign exchange.
Total organic revenue declined 3.4%.
Organic service revenue declined 12.1%.
Overall, we continue to see service declines moderate with the fourth quarter reflecting a modest improvement in service trends.
Our total organic storage rental revenue grew 1.7%, driven by revenue management.
Adjusted EBITDA was $374 million under both our new and former definition.
We exceeded the projections we shared on our last call as revenue trends, both in storage and service, were better than planned.
Fourth-quarter EBITDA reflects progress on our Summit transformation, revenue management, and favorable mix, offset by COVID-driven impacts to the business.
AFFO was $191 million or $0.66 on a per share basis, in line with our prior projections.
AFFO reflects an increase in recurring capex that have been deferred earlier in the year in higher cash taxes.
Turning to the segment performance, in the fourth quarter, our global RIM business had strong storage revenue growth, driven by volume growth in our faster-growing markets and revenue management.
This was offset by declines in service revenue, albeit at moderating levels compared to earlier in the year, leading to total organic revenue decline of 3.6%.
In our shred business, the combination of lower tonnage and an 8% decline in the paper price versus last year resulted in a net $3 million reduction in adjusted EBITDA.
While there's been a slight step-up in the index prices in January, recycled paper prices have remained low.
At recent levels, we anticipate paper prices will result in EBITDA headwind of slightly over $10 million in 2021.
We are pleased with the continued momentum in consumer storage business as it becomes a more meaningful contributor to our overall physical storage volume growth.
Global RIM adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 40 basis points, driven by revenue management and the Project Summit.
So, in the fourth quarter, we continue to see fixed cost deleverage as we ensure we are staffed to the appropriate level to fully support our customers.
We also had a step-up in facility expense as we invested in maintenance that we had delayed over the prior two quarters.
Taking a look at headline numbers for our Global Data Center business, full year bookings came in at 58.5 megawatts.
Excluding the full building lease in Frankfurt, we leased 31.5 megawatts, representing bookings growth of 26%.
Total revenue grew 9% year over year.
In 2021, we expect to lease 25 to 30 megawatts, which, at the midpoint, would result in more than 20% annual bookings growth.
We feel good about the state of our pipeline, both from a hyperscale perspective as well as our core retail colocation.
We project full year revenue growth in the range of low double digits to approaching mid-teens.
With our strong prior year bookings, we have good visibility to revenue.
For the first quarter, we expect growth rates similar to the fourth quarter as the bulk of our 2020 bookings commence in the second quarter and beyond.
Turning to Project Summit, as a reminder, we expect total program benefits of $375 million, of which we delivered $165 million in 2020.
We expect an additional $150 million benefit in 2021 with the balance in 2022.
This quarter, the team delivered $52 million of adjusted EBITDA benefit.
As to capital expenditures, in the fourth quarter, we invested $163 million, bringing the full year to $446 million, in line with our prior expectations.
In 2021, we expect total capital expenditures to be approximately $550 million, consisting of approximately $410 million of growth capex, of which we plan to allocate approximately $300 million to data center development.
We expect $140 million of recurring capex.
Turning to capital recycling.
In the fourth quarter, our program generated approximately $451 million of proceeds, which includes the Frankfurt data center joint venture we have mentioned last quarter.
And for the full year, our capital recycling program generated approximately $475 million.
I would like to call out the sale-leaseback transaction we announced in December, in which we sold a portfolio of 13 industrial facilities, generating gross proceeds of $358 million.
This portfolio was sold at a cap rate slightly below 4.5%.
This was a compelling opportunity for us to monetize a small portion of our owned industrial assets while effectively maintaining long-term control of the facilities through an initial 10-year lease with multiple renewal options, among other favorable terms.
So, on a leverage-neutral basis, this transaction freed up approximately $260 million of investable capital that we intend to redeploy into faster-growing areas, including our data center business.
We plan to make these investments in 2021, so our year-end net debt balance reflects these proceeds.
With a highly favorable market backdrop in the strong data center development pipeline, we are planning to continue the -- to recycle industrial assets.
In 2021, we are planning for $125 million of recycling.
Turning to the balance sheet.
At year-end, we had approximately $2 billion of liquidity.
We ended the year with net lease-adjusted leverage of 5.3 times, down from 5.7 times at year-end 2019.
The pro forma, excluding the investable proceeds from our leaseback, leverage would have been just slightly under 5.5 times.
As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term leverage range of 4.5 to 5.5 times.
For 2021, we expect to end the year within our target range near the high end.
With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early April.
As we have said before, we are fully committed to some of our dividend at this sustainable level.
Our long-term target for payout ratio is low to mid-60s as a percentage of AFFO.
Now to give you more details as to our outlook for 2021, we are pleased to reinstitute financial guidance reflecting the strength of our business, our team's strong execution and improved visibility.
And for the full-year 2021, we currently expect revenue of $4.325 billion to $4.475 billion.
We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.575 billion to $1.625 billion.
At the midpoint, this guidance represents revenue growth of 6% and EBITDA growth of 8%.
At the midpoint, our guidance implies about 75 basis points of EBITDA margin improvement year on year.
We expect AFFO to be in the range of $945 million to $995 million or $3.25 to $3.42 per share.
At the midpoint, this represents 9% growth for both metrics.
Our guidance assumes global physical volume will be flat to slightly positive, revenue management will be a significant benefit for us in 2021.
And I will note the majority of our actions have already been taken as we speak to you today, and nearly all of them will be in place by the end of the quarter as we are seeing in digital solutions, combined with a slight recovery in our service activity that's across the year.
In terms of EBITDA, our expectations include the benefit from revenue management and top line growth as well as Project Summit savings.
Partially offsetting those benefits is a prudent outlook for inflation, a step-up in cost from prior COVID-driven discretion, rent from some sale-leaseback transactions and innovation spend.
While we do not typically guide quarterly, with the pandemic, we felt it would be helpful to share our expectations for the first quarter.
And on a dollar basis, we expect revenue and adjusted EBITDA to be consistent to slightly up from the fourth-quarter results.
In summary, our team is executing well, visibility is improving, and our pipeline across our business has been strengthening over the last several months.
We feel well-positioned as we move into 2021.
I am confident in the team's ability to really continue to build our momentum.
